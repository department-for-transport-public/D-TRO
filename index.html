    <!-- Section 1.1 -->
    <h2 id="_Toc190681330">1.1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The Department for Transport (DfT) is modernising the regulatory
        framework for Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) (Traffic Management
        Orders in London) made under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.
    </p>
    <p>
        The new regulatory framework will, subject to necessary legislation
        coming into force, mandate that traffic authorities in England publish
        TROs as open data in a standardised and digital format that anyone can
        access, use and share. The standardised digital format will be based on
        the Digital TRO (D-TRO) Data Model that is described in this document –
        called the Data Model throughout the remainder of this document.<em></em>The 
        Data Model is intended to be a free resource for all. The Data Model is
        candidate in nature and may be subject to change without notification.
    </p>
    <p>
        Taking into account the needs arising from the UK Industrial Strategy
        and recognising the requirements that will emerge from the deployment of
        Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) the Data Model provides an
        initial framework for how the data and information relating to TROs can
        be formed in the future. Availability of this Data Model, will support
        the move towards TROs being easily accessible to the public whether
        using apps or driving connected vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Automated Vehicles Act 2024
        <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">
            [1]
        </a>
        (section 93) provides the capability for the Secretary of State, through
        regulation, to require Traffic Regulation Authorities
        <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">
            [2]

        (TRAs) to provide information on a defined set of Traffic Regulation
        Measures<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>, in a
        specified manner and form, to be provided in accordance with a specified
        model, standard or set of specifications. These will be the D-TRO Data
        Specifications including the D-TRO Data Model, and are expected to be
        specified under secondary legislation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The content of the Data Model has been developed by Harrod Booth
        Consulting Ltd with grateful support from numerous organisations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The report presents the Data Model, Release 3.3.0, with a series of
        larger updates including allowing multiple geometry representations for
        Provision RegulatedPlace(s), ability to add in diversion routes, and to
        restructure the Data Model around fields and objects relating to
        provision, regulation and condition.

    <p>
        This document outlines the data modelling concepts defined to help
        support the definition and exchange of information relating traffic
        regulations, particularly within the scope of TROs as specified under UK
        legislation (notably the Automated Vehicles Act 2024, section 93).

        As explained in the introductory sections of this document the Data
        Model contained and described here is by its nature developmental and
        evolutionary. Users, developers and stakeholders are encouraged to
        review and use this Model and provide feedback and any identified issues
        to the DfT.

        The existing informational content of the existing legacy TROs in the UK
        is diverse, rich, and in some cases somewhat incompatible with a more
        limited, regularised approach defined in this specification for
        digitising traffic regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Data Model has been the subject of ongoing development, validation
        and piloting. It is not expected to be error-free or covering the full
        spectrum of TROs – but it is expected to support the digital encoding of
        a significant majority of TROs.

    <p>
        This document is primarily intended to be read by technologists who are
        familiar with data modelling concepts, especially use of UML, as the
        contained diagrams are expressed in this notation format.
    </p>
    <p>
        As this specification evolves it is expected that additional context
        material will be made available to support ease of access to key
        concepts and principles for non-technical readers.

    </h2>
    <p>
        TROs are UK legislative instruments used by highways authorities to
        implement changes on the road network. They are used for such diverse
        purposes as:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       managing the use of the road with measures such as parking
        restrictions and speed limits,
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       allowing temporary closures for street parties and roadworks,
        and
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       experimental changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Innovations in transport and increasingly data-supported mobility are
        emerging. Foundational data, such as access to digital Traffic
        Regulation Measures, supports improved use of our transport
        infrastructure, forming an important element of this digital journey, to
        enhanced mobility services.
    </p>
    <p>
        The
        <strong>
            Local Transport Data Discovery
            Report<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><strong>[4]</strong></a>,
        </strong>
        published by DfT in 2018, explored the transport data held by Local
        Authorities. Its key findings relating to TROs were that:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       TRO data is difficult and time consuming to access, clean and
        process,
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       TRO data is not in a standardised, machine-readable format,
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       TROs lack of a centralised point of reference,
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Private sector organisations are being forced to collect TRO
        data manually, and
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      The current process for amending and implementing a TRO is labour
        intensive, time consuming, and costly.
    </p>
    <p>
        The report recommended that the DfT sponsor data projects which
        encourage and foster better local authority transport services,
        including streamlining and digitising TROs.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, several projects have followed, and in combination the
        development of this Data Model. These projects were as follows:

            <strong>Policy Alpha</strong>
        </a>
        <strong></strong>(2019-20) [undertaken by PA Consulting] to identify
        improvements to the legislative process in England. Strongly recommended
        development of the TRO data model as a matter of priority.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through 2019-20 DfT worked with several local authorities to undertake a
        <strong>first validation of the TRO Data Model</strong> with 8 Local
        Authorities and market-leading solution providers.
    </p>
    <p>
        DfT commissioned the <strong>TRO Data Model Alpha</strong><em></em>[undertaken 
        by Valtech] (2020-21) giving recommendations on expected market
        deployment of the TRO data model, and how TRO data from LAs would be
        made available.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2021-22 there was further data model validation and enhancement using
        real-world <strong>Data Model Validation</strong> of TROs from four
        local authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2022 DfT undertook a <strong>Policy Consultation</strong> concerning
        the assessment of changes in TRO legislation.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information concerning TROs see the British Parking
        Association's (BPA) Best Practice Guide for TROs:

        In 2023, Informed Solutions conducted a <strong>Service Alpha</strong>
        developing the 3.1.1 version of the Data Model and conducting
        pre-production Alpha testing with a small set of TRAs involved.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>D-TRO Beta project</strong> is currently underway, conducted
        by PA Consulting, with main updates on the Data Model proposed being the
        implementation of records management, live reporting of TTROs and
        enabling more effective location referencing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Automated Vehicles Act 2024</strong> (section 93) received
        Royal Assent in May 2024. It provides the capability for the Secretary
        of State through regulation to require TRAs to provide information on a
        defined set of TROs, in a specified manner and form, to be provided in
        accordance with a specified model, standard or set of specifications.

        <a name="_Toc190681340">2.1.    Background</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Data modelling is by its nature open to interpretation, different
        approaches and may reflect the personal preferences of those developing
        it.
    </p>
    <p>
        DfT agreed that the modelling approach would seek to achieve several
        aims:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       It provides as simple a structure as is possible to model a wide
        spectrum of traffic regulation concepts as is practicable
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Where appropriate, aligned to internationally recognised
        standards (see section 2.6).
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Based on an appropriate and relevant data structure.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Compatible with other standards where possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       As open and accessible as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        The management and exchange of traffic regulations and TROs is a
        strengthening need, that will support the digitisation of traffic,
        vehicle automation and enhanced data-centric transport and mobility
        services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Transport and mobility include both the short local and cross-border
        long-distance journey. There is a need to develop common national
        mechanisms to ensure the efficient and safe movement of vehicles and
        road users. Commonality is needed to support travel between
        jurisdictions, but also the consistent sharing and use of TRO data.
    </p>
    <p>
        At present, although international conventions support the free movement
        of road traffic and general conditions for safe common road use, and
        other road features such as common aspects of road signs, there are no
        existing common technical standards for how to encode and model road
        traffic regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Data Model is the first national recognised effort to support such
        encoding, expressly for the purpose of exchanging details concerning
        road traffic regulations, their location and features as well as the
        traffic impact that they create. The Data Model is expected to form part
        of the "with a specified model, standard or set of specifications"
        specifications as mentioned in the Automated Vehicles Act 2024, section
        93(8).
    </p>

        <a name="_Toc190681341">2.2.    General concepts</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
        TROs are complex and have been specified by highway authorities (and now
        TRAs) over an extended period, with quite some variation of style and
        approach. Developing the Data Model is challenging and therefore choices
        and simplifications are needed. The Data Model has been subject to
        modification and enhancement through a series of projects and also in
        response to comments and issues raised through validation undertaken by
        some Local Authorities and their existing TRO software service
        providers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Onward reviews and use of this model will identify omissions and
        exceptions, but the design principles adopted seek to provide clear data
        modelling constructs to cover a range of key concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
        When considering TROs there are various aspects that could be the
        subject of modelling:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The legal Order itself, as made by the TRA
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Road network features (instantiated by the Order) that control
        the movement of traffic, use of the highways, etc, which includes the
        modelling of the traffic effect of the regulation for that feature
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Modelling of road traffic signs
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Modelling of road markings and other traffic management measures
    </p>
    <p>
        DfT focus for the Data Model has been to develop a firm technical basis
        to support the encoding, exchange, storage and distribution of details
        of the legal contents of the TRO itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        The scope of the Data Model covers all different forms of Order
        (permanent, temporary, experimental and notices) for both moving and
        stationary traffic.
    </p>

        <a name="_Toc190681342">2.3.    Design principles</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The following design principles have reflected the shaping of the Data
        Model:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The scope of the Data Model shall cover all different forms of
        Order (permanent, temporary, experimental and notices) for both moving
        and stationary traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The Data Model will seek to include the full semantic contents
        of (a largely majority of) TROs. This notes that there is wide variety
        in the form and content of existing TROs, and attempting to model all
        content and options is both impractical and counter-productive to the
        intent of creating standardised digital TRO records based on a common
        data structure as defined by the Data Model.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The Data Model will seek to simplify data structures as much as
        practical.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The Data Model design will be cognisant of user needs in terms
        of provisioning of digital TRO records, the most likely use cases for
        consumption and reuse of digital TRO records, and supporting DfT policy
        objectives, as well as supporting automated validation.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Where appropriate, the Data Model will align and reuse concepts
        specified in appropriate European or International Standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The Data Model shall be extensible. The current landscape,
        format and content of 'made' TROs contains wide diversity. As part of
        the process of digitalising and regularising TRO information in the form
        of D-TRO records, it is essential to try to bound possible options and
        characteristics in an extensive, inclusive but ultimately limited way.
        It is important to provide technical mechanisms within the structure of
        the Data Model and its implementation in the D-TRO service to enable
        some of the key vocabulary to be extended in an ad-hoc user driven way.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is a matter of service governance that use of the extension
        mechanism, mentioned above, should only be used when absolutely
        necessary. This will ensure that the consistency of the collected set of
        D-TRO records is maintained. However, legitimate need to extend values
        beyond the 'hard coded' values in the Data Model is essential. Regular
        use of extended items should raise the need for their consideration of
        inclusion in a revision of the Data Model – as part of the expected
        regime of the Data Model governance.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The Data Model shall be designed and represented in a manner
        that aligns with Government policies and is portable, and suitable for
        long term maintenance.

    </h2>
    <p>
        As reflected in the design principles, above, ongoing work is reviewing
        user needs for digital TRO records, and therefore the foreseen
        deployment of the D-TRO Service and the Data Model.
    </p>
    <p>
        This section does not seek to replicate the wide spectrum of needs but
        highlights a handful of considerations that shape the way in which the
        Data Model is expected to be used.
    </p>
    <p>
        DfT, through the previous Service Alpha and current Beta Project, are
        reviewing and enhancing user needs analysis, prototyping the D-TRO
        Service, and reviewing the Data Model. Therefore, updates and changes
        may occur.
    </p>
    <p>
        The DfT's preferred option is to establish a centralised service which
        receives digital TROs (D-TROs) from TRAs, stores these records, and
        exposes data services for consumers to request distribution of D-TRO
        records. The Data Model forms the technical baseline for D-TRO records.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to the variety of different forms of TRO and notices permitted under
        the legislation, there is a need to define in future legislation and
        statutory guidance when in the lifecycle of orders and notices the TRA
        will be required to provide a D-TRO record to the D-TRO Service. The
        current expectation is that the following Reporting Points are needed –
        see Figure 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a name="_Ref135989907">Figure</a> 2 – D-TRO Reporting Points
        (Provisional)
    </p>
    <p>
        These Reporting Points are reflected in the Data Model in an enumerated
        list named
        'orderReportingPointType'<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is not foreseen that the D-TRO Central Service will in the future
        retain a full, growing library of all D-TROs submitted over time, but
        retain recently submitted D-TRO records and those that remain current.
        The Service is also expected to hold future D-TRO records, and those
        that have recently expired, or replaced by a newer amended version, or
        revoked. The precise definition of this Service is currently being
        defined through this Beta project, with initial version for a records
        management capability being implemented.

        The Data Model has been modelled in UML (Unified Modelling Language)
        following Model Driven Architecture design principles. Sparx Systems
        Enterprise Architect, a visual modelling and design tool, has been used

    <p>
        A QEA extract is provided specific to Enterprise Architect that contain

        This will allow users who have Enterprise Architect software to directly
        open, view, modify, and work with the model in the same environment it
        was created. An XMI extract is also provided to allow import of the Data
        Model into other modelling tools or software applications that support

        Alignment with other standards
    </h2>
    <p>
        This document and the Data Model reuse some well-known, widely deployed
        model fragments that appear in several European and International
        standards:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The "Condition" sub-model is specified in both "TN-ITS"
        CEN/TS17268:2018 and "APDS" ISO/TS 5206-1:2023,
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The "TimeValidity" sub-model is an adaptation of "TimeValidity"
        package specified in "DATEX II" CEN/TS 16157-7:2018,
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The "VehicleCharacteristics" sub-model specified in "DATEX II"
        CEN/TS 16157-7:2018,
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The "Rates" sub-model is specified in "APDS" ISO/TS 5206-1:2023.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the Data Model has been reviewed for application in the UK, and
        in some cases the values appearing in the lists contained the Data Model
        have been adjusted with additions, deletions and adjustments when
        compared to the Standards content.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Data Model supports conditions that relate to the vehicle type,
        vehicle usage, vehicle dimensions, fuel type, etc. These condition lists
        were reviewed from the viewpoint of normal practice in the UK by
        experienced practitioners. This has resulted in a profiling of these
        condition types and lists that are more suitable for current UK
        practice.

        Location Referencing
    </h2>
    <p>
        One of the technical aspects within the D-TRO Beta Data Specification
        which requires further clarification and resolution, is how to
        systematically encode information relating to the spatial location and
        positioning used within TROs. Currently, an approach has been proposed
        to shape the data structures that are needed to support it within the
        D-TRO Beta Data Specification and its Data Model.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to make future digital TROs useable to the widest set of
        stakeholders and applications the provision of a coded location that is
        machine-interpretable and can be related to specific spatially coded
        locations on digital maps is considered essential.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following stakeholder comment, DfT has revised the proposed recommended
        approach. Given the need to reduce barriers to uptake during the D-TRO
        Beta project phase, no singular preferred approach is mandated.
        Therefore, for example, a speed limit TRO provision can be represented
        either by linear road centreline/reference line features (polyline) or
        by use of a polygon. Similarly, kerb line regulations can be represented
        as a polyline, a polygon or both. This approach will be reviewed during
        the D-TRO Beta project, taking on board feedback primarily from data
        consumers concerning the useability of mixed approach data.
    </p>
    <p>
        DfT prefers the use of polygons, but these are not mandatory.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some forms of TRO do require special treatment to ensure that the data
        can be correctly interpreted. This special treatment applies to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Gate/point locations
        </li>
        <li>
            Directional regulations (such as no entry, one-way streets, turning
            movements, etc.)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There is a need to provide clear guidance and a common approach to
        enable TRAs to code TRO locations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Single consolidated or other TROs may represent a range of measures
        (Provisions) impacting different locations – this approach should
        support TRAs identifying and encoding "regulated place" in a manner that
        they consider appropriate. The approach aims to limit specific coding
        rules to a practical minimum, enabling both alignment with the more
        commonly used existing practice whilst counter-balancing use of a
        limited number of coding mechanisms which will aid greater commonality
        and interoperability of data.
    </p>
    <p>
        In general, if a TRO regulation is identified as being effective at two
        or more distinct locations, each location should be treated as a
        separate "regulated place", as laid out in the D-TRO Data Specification.
        The design approach aims to address the wide spectrum of different forms
        of shape that TRO regulations can take.
    </p>
    <p>
        The standardised approach:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            should not be tied to a specific form of reference base map data
            set.
        </li>
        <li>
            shall use a widely understood and supported standardised data
            format.
        </li>
        <li>
            should be cognisant of the level of effort required to achieve it.
        </li>
        <li>
            should support the needs of identified use cases, so far as these
            are defined.
        </li>
        <li>
            should separate the principles of what is being encoded, from the
            actual IT-centric coding mechanism itself.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The D-TRO Beta Data Specification uses of The OSGB36 / British National
        Grid Coordinate Reference System (ESPG:27700).  In the current D-TRO
        Private Beta Data Specification the Well-Known Text (WKT) geometry
        standard - ISO/IEC 13249-3:2016 shall be used for the encoding of
        geometric coordinates.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is no support in the D-TRO Beta Data Specification to enable the
        upload of scan or electronic version of TROs, schedules, or associated
        maps.

    <p>
        Standardisation becomes increasingly important to ensure consistency and
        interoperability by facilitating a uniform understanding of traffic
        regulations across various regions and platforms. This uniformity is
        essential for the development of interoperable digital systems that can
        communicate and integrate seamlessly. For instance, a term like
        "no-stopping" (kerbsideNoStopping) should have a universally accepted
        definition to avoid discrepancies between different technology providers
        used by TRAs, navigation systems, and other traffic management
        applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clear and consistent definitions in digital TROs help in maintaining
        legal clarity. Inconsistent or ambiguous terms can lead to
        misinterpretation of the regulations, resulting in legal challenges and
        non-compliance.  With D-TROs also supporting the rise of intelligent
        transport systems, automated vehicles, and advanced navigation aids,
        this depends heavily on the availability of standardised digital
        information. For these technologies to function correctly and interact
        with human drivers and existing infrastructure, they need access to
        precise and consistent regulatory data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recognising the critical need for standardisation, an assessment is
        currently underway to collate and analyse the varied uses of terms
        across different sources relevant to TROs. This comprehensive assessment
        involves examining the language used in existing TRO documents from
        multiple authorities, reviewing legislative texts, and consulting with
        stakeholders in the Transport Technology Forum and wider. The goal is to
        identify inconsistencies and ambiguities in the current terminologies
        and to propose a harmonised set of definitions that can be adopted
        universally.

    </h2>
    <p>
        As you work through this user guide you will see attributes that are
        specified in the different objects are assigned specific data types.
        These help a developer know the whether the attribute gains its
        potential values from the entries in an enumerated list (such as
        vehicleType), or is a date, a date-time, a web address (URI – a
        Universal Resource Identifier), string (for free text), etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Data Model is specified using a convention Unified Modelling
        Language (UML). From this model we generate a JSON (JavaScript Notation)
        schema which provide the template for exchangeable structured data.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a limited number of cases the data type shown in the Data Model is
        translated into a data type that conforms to the JSON specification.
        These translations are as follows:

    <p>
        This section provides a tour of the main features of the Data Model.
    </p>
    <p>
        Figure 3 shows a summarised simplified view of the main structures of
        the Data Model. These structures often contain more detailed sub-models,
        which are detailed later in this section.
    </p>
    <p>
        One way to think of the organisation of the information is that each
        Digital TRO record (D-TRO record) contains the information contained in
        one TRO. Each D-TRO record needs to contain information on the 'what',
        'where', 'when', and 'who' concepts. The 'who' concept is covered by
        what conditions apply, and what exemptions or exclusions exist. For TROs
        that incur a form of payment or charging, the 'how much' concept can
        also be expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
        As denoted in Figure 3, these concepts are held within different
        structures.

    <p>
        Each TRO will be characterised by one D-TRO record. In other words, all
        the informational detail of one TRO should be contained in one D-TRO
        record.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: There is a set of metadata attributes that contain information on
        when the D-TRO record was published by the TRA or their software service
        provider, and the identity of the publishing entity. These metadata
        elements form part of the exchange mechanism itself and sit beyond the
        contents of the Data Model, forming part of the schema used for
        exchange. Details of these metadata attributes are provided in the Data
        Specification's Interface Control Documents.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Source</strong> object contains basic information concerning
        which TRA which created this TRO, the TRA which is the current owner of
        the TRO, the TRAs that are affected by the TRO. The formal published
        name of the TRO is also supported.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, <strong>Source</strong> permits linking to any other
        digitised TRO that is referenced within this TRO. The cross reference is
        the unique D-TRO record identifier ID, not a textual name of a TRO.
    </p>
    <p>
        In each D-TRO record, it is possible to define one or many Source
        objects, with each Source object being related to one section or clause
        in the TRO.

    <p>
        The <strong>Source</strong> object defines several mandatory attributes.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The 'troName' attribute</strong> is the cited name of the
        Traffic Regulation Order (TRO) as defined by the Traffic Regulation
        Authority (TRA). The data type is a (free text) String. This attribute
        is mandatory and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The 'section' attribute</strong> indicates the clause,
        schedule, or article defined by the TRA where the related Provisions can
        be located. The data type is a (free text) String. This attribute is
        mandatory and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The 'actionType' attribute</strong> indicates the action type
        to be carried out by the source, with a 'reference' ID provided to link
        to the current source on which the action is being executed. The data
        type is ActionType (enumeration). Possible values are shown in Figure 6.
        This attribute is mandatory and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The 'actionType' attribute</strong> indicates the action type
        to be carried out by the source, with a 'reference' ID provided to link
        to the current source on which the action is being executed. The data
        type is ActionType (enumeration). Possible values are shown in Figure 6.
        This attribute is mandatory and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The 'reference' attribute</strong> is a unique identifier for
        each instance of a Source by originating TRA. The precise format of the
        reference is not prescribed and is left to the discretion of the data
        supplier. It is, however, mandatory and shall be unique for the
        originating TRA. The data type is a (free text) String. This attribute
        is required and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The 'comingIntoForceDate' attribute</strong> specifies the
        date on which the TRO comes into legal effect. The data type is a date.
        This attribute is required and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The 'currentTraOwner' attribute</strong> identifies the
        current Traffic Regulation Authority responsible for maintaining this
        D-TRO. The value should correspond to a SWA-like authority code. The
        data type is an integer. This attribute is required and must be provided
        exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The 'madeDate' attribute</strong> indicates the date that the
        TRO was made, if applicable. The data type is a date. This attribute is
        optional.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The 'statementDescription' attribute</strong> provides a
        description of the overall nature of the prohibition, regulation, or
        restriction imposed by the TRO. The data type is a (free text) String.
        This attribute is optional and may appear multiple times if needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The 'traAffected' attribute</strong> identifies the Traffic
        Regulation Authorities whose roads are affected by this D-TRO. The value
        should correspond to one or more SWA-like codes. The data type is an
        integer. At least one entry is required.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The 'traCreator' attribute</strong> identifies the Highway
        Regulation Authority that created the D-TRO. The value should be a
        SWA-like code. The data type is an integer. This attribute is mandatory
        and must be provided exactly once.

        <a name="_Ref168310838">Figure</a>6 - Enumeration values for actionType
    </p>
    <p>
        The actionType attribute specifies the type of action being taken with
        respect to a specific version of a D-TRO. It is used to indicate how the
        current version relates to any earlier version(s) of the same Traffic
        Regulation Order. The data type is a string constrained to a defined set
        of controlled vocabulary values. This attribute is mandatory and must be
        provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        Permitted values include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>new</strong> – Indicates that the supplied D-TRO version is
            entirely new and not an amendment of any earlier version.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>fullAmendment</strong> – Indicates that the supplied version
            fully replaces and amends an earlier version of the D-TRO.

            revoked in its entirety.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>partialRevoke</strong> – Indicates that the D-TRO is
            partially revoked, affecting only certain elements of the earlier
            version.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>noChange</strong> – Indicates that the supplied version does
            not introduce any changes from the previous D-TRO version.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>errorFix</strong> – Indicates that the current version
            corrects one or more errors present in an earlier version.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>amendment</strong> – A general indicator that the current
            version introduces amendments to a prior version, where the specific
            nature of amendment (full or partial) is not further detailed.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This classification allows systems and users to track the evolution of
        legal traffic regulations and their current applicability in a
        structured and machine-readable way.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Source</strong> object also contains three additional
        mandatory attributes, which may be subject to change due to on-going
        design considerations:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The 'traCreator' attribute gives the code for the TRA that
        created the Order or Notice.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The 'traCurrentOwner' attribute gives the code for the TRA that
        is the current responsible party for the Order or Notice.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The 'traAffected' attribute identifies, by use of the code, one
        or several TRAs whose roads are subject to the Provisions of the Order
        or Notice. This is an array of integer values. Note: in this version,
        this includes the creating TRA. This may be changed in future versions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The codes will be defined is a manner similar to the SWA codes used for
        street works. These attributes allow the tracing of the original creator
        and current responsible TRA owner and also those TRAs affected – this
        supports where boundary changes, authority name changes, etc. It will be
        quite common for all three attributes to identify the same TRA where no
        significant changes have occurred, and the TRO content relates only to
        the originating TRA's road network.
    </p>
    <p>
        We then move on to the <strong>Provision</strong> object. Provisions are
        an important concept – each instance of Provision represents
        specifically one type of <strong>Regulation</strong>, subject to one set
        of homogeneous conditions (conditions, exemptions, and times of
        applicability, and, if applicable, tariff rates), that are relevant to
        one or several <strong>RegulatedPlace</strong>(s).
    </p>

                        regulation indicating both a changed speed limit,
                        introduction of a new bus lane and kerbside parking and
                        waiting regulations in the same street location.  These
                        would be, at least, three distinct Provisions.

    </table>
    <p>
        Within each TRO, multiple Sources may be defined; with each Source
        object being related to one section or clause in the TRO.
    </p>
    <p>
        Related to each Source object, multiple Provision objects may be
        defined. Each instance of <strong>Provision</strong> shall be related to
        one instance of <strong>Regulation.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The relationship between the objects Provision, RegulatedPlace and
        Regulation is shown in Figure 7.

        of the Provision, RegulatedPlace and Regulation objects
    </p>
    <p>
        By way of illustration, consider one TRO that contains two Provisions.
        The first Provision is, say, a kerbside parking place regulation,
        regulated to be applicable 24 hours, 7 days per week, relevant to
        locations A, B and C. The second Provision is, say, a kerbside loading
        place regulation, regulated to be useable between 06:00 am and 08:00 on
        weekdays, limited to commercial vehicles, relevant to locations D and F.

        Provision Object
    </p>
    <p>
        The Provision object defines several mandatory attributes.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      The 'actionType' attribute indicates the action to be carried out
        by the Provision, with a 'reference' ID provided to link to the current
        Provision the action is being carried out on. See section 3.2. The data
        type is ActionType (enumeration). This attribute is mandatory and must
        be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      The 'comingIntoForceDate' attribute specifies the date on which
        the Provision comes into legal effect. The data type is date. This
        attribute is mandatory and must be provided exactly once. <br/>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      The 'expectedOccupancyDuration' attribute specifies the expected
        duration (in integer days) of the Provision's occupancy. The data type
        is duration. This attribute is optional, but recommended where relevant
        to the type of regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      The 'orderReportingPoint' attribute indicates at which of the
        recognised Reporting Points this Provision instance rests. Reporting
        Points are described in more detail in section 2.4. The data type is
        OrderReportingPointType (enumeration). This attribute is mandatory and
        must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      The 'provisionDescription' attribute provides a free text
        description of the referenced Provision. The data type is a string (free
        text). This attribute is mandatory and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      The 'reference' attribute is a unique identifier for each
        instance of a Provision by the originating TRA. The precise format of
        the reference is not prescribed and is left to the discretion of the
        data supplier. It is, however, mandatory and shall be unique for the
        originating TRA. The data type is a string (free text). This attribute
        is required and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Provision class may also be extended by either an
        ExperimentalVariation or an ExperimentalCessation.
    </p>

            An <strong>ExperimentalVariation</strong> describes a planned change
            in regulatory effect, including the effectOfChange and an
            expectedDuration in days.
        </li>
        <li>
            An <strong>ExperimentalCessation</strong> defines the end of a
            provision under an experimental context, including the
            actualDateOfCessation and the natureOfCessation.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This model supports both permanent and time-bound experimental
        regulations, ensuring flexibility in managing regulatory states and
        their lifecycle within a traffic order.

    <p>
        The <strong>ExperimentalVariation</strong> class is a JSON element used
        to define the characteristics of a variation applied to an Experimental
        Traffic Regulation Order (Experimental Order). This class captures both
        the nature and duration of the variation, enabling detailed
        documentation and structured data handling of experimental regulatory
        changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        This class is associated with the Provision object, representing a
        specific regulatory effect that is subject to temporary or trial
        variation under legal experimentation powers.

        The <strong>ExperimentalCessation</strong>class is a JSON element used
        to define the characteristics of a cessation applied to an Experimental
        Traffic Regulation Order (Experimental Order). This class enables the
        structured recording of the end of an experimental regulatory provision,
        including both the cessation date and its rationale.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is associated with a Provision that was enacted under experimental
        powers and has since been formally ceased, either upon conclusion of its
        intended trial period or for other operational or legal reasons.

        Each <strong>Regulation</strong> object defines one and only one form of

    <p>
        Regulations fall into one of four categories:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       SpeedLimitValueBased – which are speed limit regulations based
        upon a declared speed limit. As the default speed limit for well-lit
        streets may not be 30 mph, it is necessary to define the value alongside
        the speedLimitValueType enum.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       SpeedLimitProfileBased – which are based on speed limit
        regulations. For example, one profile is
        'nationalSpeedLimitDualCarriageway', others are
        'nationalSpeedLimitSingleCarriageway' and 'nationalSpeedLimitMotorway'.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       GeneralRegulation – characterising a wider range of regulations
        – see later for further details.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       OffListRegulation – which characterises an extension mechanism
        for a TRA to declare a form of Regulation that is not otherwise covered
        by the regulations specified in the first two categories.

        The <strong>Regulation</strong> object defines two mandatory attributes.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The 'isDynamic' attribute indicates whether the Regulation
        identified is dynamic in nature (i.e., the Regulation is triggered by
        some condition – for example, changeable speed limits, access
        regulations, or triggered by environment conditions). The value 'True'
        indicates the Regulation is dynamic in nature; 'False' indicates the
        Regulation is static.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The 'timeZone' attribute enables the time zone applicable to the
        Regulation to be defined. This is important in supporting the management
        of the definition of clearly specified times that work appropriately in
        local time zones. The time zone is specified IANA time zone (see

        Note: It is acknowledged that existing practice for defining TROs in
        different TRAs may use slightly different terms to describe what
        fundamentally are the same regulatory concept. To improve the
        interoperability of TRO data coming from different TRAs, mapping of
        locally adopted terms to the regulation types given in the list above is
        essential. Genuinely new, distinct regulation concepts can be provided
        using the OffListRegulation mechanism described below – but this should
        be rarely used.

    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The 'mphValue' attribute gives the integer value of the speed

        integer. This attribute is mandatory and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The 'nature' attribute specifies the nature of the speed limit,
        such as whether it is advisory, mandatory, or temporary. The data type
        is SpeedLimitNatureType (enumeration). This attribute is optional but
        recommended for clarity.

        ●       The 'type' attribute indicates the type of profile for speed

        The Data Model is experimental in nature and there is a real-world road
        network usage and therefore TROs (e.g., consider the relatively recent
        introduction of e-Scooters). The Data Model supports a couple of
        different approaches to support extension to new situations and
        regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a new form of regulation is required, beyond those already specified
        in the Data Model, the <strong>OffListRegulation</strong> object can be
        used.

    <p>
        The OffListRegulation object has three attributes:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The mandatory 'regulationShortName' attribute enables the TRA to
        give a short name for the new extended regulation type. This typically
        is less than 30 characters in length. For example,
        "kerbsideEScooterParking" or "kerbsidePublicMobileRobotParking".
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The mandatory 'regulationFullText' attribute contains the full
        descriptive text used in the TRO for the new extended regulation type.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Optionally, multiple references to the new extended regulation
        may be provided. This may be a reference to a clause in the TRO or a
        Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to supporting published material.
    </p>
    <p>
        In instances where a temporary regulation temporarily replaces a
        pre-existing regulation the <strong>TemporaryRegulation</strong> object
        may be used to indicate references to pre-existing regulation(s).

                            the case of amendments, revocations, variations by
                            notice and consolidations.

    <p>
        As part of records management, the Central Service will maintain a "live
        TRO" list, which may be modified by the receipt of a new inbound Order
        or Notice received by the Central Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      An <strong>Amendment</strong> Order can change or remove anything
        in an existing order – or orders – and add new provisions and revoke
        other orders.
    </p>
    <p>
        •    A revocation is a type of amendment order, that does not have any
        new provisions. An order that only contains revocations will still be
        advertised and consulted upon. The receipt of a record that is
        identified solely as a revocation into the central service, does not
        automatically mean that any referenced previous orders will be removed
        from the "live TRO" list. An order that is solely a revocation may only
        revoke parts of an old order and leave other parts intact – this may be
        a partial revocation of a Provision within a previous TRO.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      Parking tariffs are varied by use of a
        <strong>
            variation by notice
        </strong>
        . As the initial tariffs may have been specified in the original full
        order, this can have the effect of being an amendment to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      A <strong>consolidation</strong> is an administrative process and
        nothing 'of substance' should be added or removed. Generally, a
        consolidation would combine a base order and its subsequent amendments
        into a new base order. If something is missed from the revocation list
        of a consolidation, then the remaining pre-existing Provisions (partial
        or whole) might be orphaned but still be in force. These always have
        multiple revocations by definition.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      A <strong>consolidation</strong> can be used to change some
        details of a previously made TRO, so long as this does not affect the
        substance of the Order. Things can be tidied up if required (noting
        there is small defined list of minor changes that are allowed) but
        nothing should be changed that would ordinarily require consultation.
        The opportunity to make changes is very limited. However, as a side
        note, this can be complicated by the fact that some people refer to the
        combination of old orders with substantial changes as a consolidation,
        which it is not.
    </p>
    <p>
        We require that all (versions of) Orders and Notices received shall
        contain "minimum contextual content" (i.e. the who, what, when and how
        much, if relevant, of any Provision). This requirement is defined by the
        minimum mandatory data elements within the Data Model. Effectively new
        versions will replace older versions within the Live TRO list – old
        versions will remain visible for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whilst the central service currently will hold records for all D-TRO
        records it has received, D-TRO records management mean that new versions
        of TROs (and their Provisions) – through amendments and revocations –
        will supersede earlier versions. Each version is considered to be a
        complete representation of the TRO and its Provisions. Older records
        that have been amended or revoked will be visible in the Central Service
        for a defined retention period, before being archived.

        The Source and Provision objects have been described above in section
        3.1, with an illustrative example shown in Figure 17.

    <p>
        <a name="_Ref183457899">Figure</a>17 – Records Management Example for
        Source &amp; Provision
    </p>
    <p>
        The example shown above illustrates the D-TROs records management in
        progress. The left-hand side shows a new TRO, being submitted as a D-TRO
        into the central service (via the "Create D-TRO" process).
    </p>
    <p>
        It contains multiple Sources and Provisions. For the purpose of this
        illustration, we focus on Source #1 (with reference TRAxxxx-So-01, and
        actionType = 'new'). It has two child Provisions:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      Provision #1 with Reference: TRAxxxx-Pro-01 and actionType =
        'new', and
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      Provision #2 with Reference: TRAxxxx-Pro-12 and actionType =
        'new'
    </p>
    <p>
        At a later point in time, the TRA makes a new (Consolidation) TRO with
        Reference TRAxxxx-SO-09, and actionType = 'Amendment'.  We highlight two
        of the provisions in the example:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      Provision #1, with Reference: TRAxxxx-Pro-01 and actionType =
        'partialAmendment', and
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      Provision #7, with Reference: TRAxxxx-Pro-12 and actionType =
        'fullRevoke'
    </p>
    <p>
        For the new Provision #1, as this has the same reference as Provision #1
        from the earlier TRO, and an action type of 'partialAmendment', this
        instance of the Provision is considered to fully replace the earlier
        instance. The old version of Provision #1 with Reference: TRAxxxx-Pro-01
        will be marked in the D-TRO Service database as not current and replaced
        by a newer version.
    </p>
    <p>
        For Provision #7, as this has the same reference as Provision #2 from
        the earlier TRO, and an action type of 'fullRevoke', this instance of
        the Provision is considered to fully replace the earlier instance. The
        old version of Provision #2 with Reference: TRAxxxx-Pro-12 will be
        marked in the D-TRO Service database as not current.
    </p>
    <p>
        When using actionType's for Amendment ('fullAmendment' or
        'partialAmendment') the old Provision (or Source is considered to be
        fully replaced by the new Provision. The same applies to amendment of
        Sources. The distinction between 'fullAmendment' and 'partialAmendment'
        does not change the action of the D-TRO service records management, but
        rather may be helpful metadata for data consumers to correctly interpret
        updates between records. The same records management approach applies to
        'partialRevoke'.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use of 'fullyRevoke' does not replace the older record by a newer one,
        but rather triggers the older record to be marked in the D-TRO Service
        database as not current.
    </p>
    <p>
        The use of the actionType 'new' is interpreted by the D-TRO service as
        the newer records being unrelated to older records. Both will be
        considered to be current in the D-TRO Service database.

        In order to make future digital TROs useable to the widest set of
        stakeholders and applications the provision of a coded location that is
        machine-interpretable and can be related to specific spatially coded
        locations on digital maps is considered essential. Providing clear
        information on the geographic spatial location that are subject to
        regulations is a critical element of the D-TRO record.
    </p>
    <p>
        No single preferred approach is mandated at this current stage.
        Therefore, for example, a speed limit TRO provision can be represented
        either by linear road centreline/reference line features (polyline) or
        by use of a polygon. Similarly, kerb line regulations can be represented
        as a polyline, a polygon or both.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following sections lay out a standardised approach for how the
        location data for TRO regulations should be handled. All TRO regulation
        measures shall be defined geospatially, using coordinates and coded in
        WKT (Well Known Text) format.
    </p>
    <p>
        The standardised approach covers general concepts, such as where to
        place spatial polygons or polyline in different circumstances, which is
        expected to be appropriate for most forms of TRO regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The standardised approach addresses:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      Instances where TRO regulations are subject to a direction, such
        as one-way streets, no entry restrictions, banned turns, etc
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      Cases where TRO regulations may apply to roads that appear
        coincident on a map but are grade separated vertically.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      The topic of providing additional contextual information that
        enables the TRO regulation locations to be associated directly with
        references found in well-known road network model data sets,

        A TRO may contain multiple distinct regulations (measures) which relate
        to potentially numerous Regulated Places. The shape/geometry of the
        spatial footprint of a Regulated Place may not be well defined in
        existing and current new TROs. Table 1 provides an overview of the forms
        of shape/geometry for TRO regulations.

    <p>
        A <strong>RegulatedPlace</strong> represents a real-world identifiable
        location which is where the Provision and related Regulation(s) are
        applicable to. There is no particular limitation or rules concerning
        specifying a RegulatedPlace, or choosing to define the zone of influence
        into several RegulatedPlace – this is a choice of the TRA.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each RegulatedPlace shall have one or, potentially more than one,
        specified <strong>Geometry</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If multiple Geometry instances exist for a RegulatedPlace each Geometry
        instance represents an alternative version (alternative representation)
        of the same location. They are not intended to define different
        real-world locations. Each instance of Geometry for a RegulatedPlace
        shall have a unique version attribute value (see Figure 21 below). This
        enables a TRA to represent a RegulatedPlace using, say, a polygon-based
        geometry in one version, and a polyline-based geometry in a second
        version.

        The details provided in the Geometry object alone are not sufficient to
        define the spatial geometry of the RegulatedPlace and provide meaningful
        semantic content to explain what the given geometry means. Therefore,
        four specialisations of different forms of geometry are supported.
    </p>
    <p>
        The four specialisations are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            PointGeometry – where the supplied geometry identifies a point
            location, the context of this point location is given in the
            PointGeometry object.
        </li>
        <li>
            LinearGeometry – where the supplied geometry identifies a polyline
            location, the context of this polyline (linear location) is given in
            the LinearGeometry object.
        </li>
        <li>
            Polygon – where the supplied geometry identifies polygon (zone or
            area) location, the context of this polygon location is given in the
            Polygon object.
        </li>
        <li>
            DirectedLinear – where the supplied geometry a defined movement
            between two (or linked multiple more) locations (such as defining a
            banned turn between North Way and East Street), the context of
            motion (directed linear location) is given in the DirectedLinear
            object.
        </li>

        The PointGeometry object has a single mandatory attribute,

    <p>
        The LinearGeometry object has four attributes:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The mandatory 'representation' attribute which identifies where
        the given linear geometry is represents a linear feature location (e.g.,
        a stretch of kerbline) and is a representation of zonal object (e.g.,
        the reference centreline of a length of road, where the location of
        applicability is the whole width of the road for the defined length).
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The mandatory 'direction' attribute indicates the direction of
        the applicability of the referenced regulation. Acceptable values are:
        'bidirectional', 'startToEnd', and 'endToStart'. Note this can be used
        to support the definition of the direction of a direction sensitive
        regulation on, say, a single road section (e.g. a northbound direction

    <p>
        The Department for Transport (DfT) is modernising the regulatory
        framework for Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) (Traffic Management
        Orders in London) made under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.
    </p>
    <p>
        The new regulatory framework will, subject to necessary legislation
        coming into force, mandate that traffic authorities in England publish
        TROs as open data in a standardised and digital format that anyone can
        access, use and share. The standardised digital format will be based on
        the Digital TRO (D-TRO) Data Model that is described in this document –
        called the Data Model throughout the remainder of this document.<em></em>The 
        Data Model is intended to be a free resource for all. The Data Model is
        candidate in nature and may be subject to change without notification.
    </p>
    <p>
        Taking into account the needs arising from the UK Industrial Strategy
        and recognising the requirements that will emerge from the deployment of
        Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) the Data Model provides an
        initial framework for how the data and information relating to TROs can
        be formed in the future. Availability of this Data Model, will support
        the move towards TROs being easily accessible to the public whether
        using apps or driving connected vehicles.

        Provision RegulatedPlace(s), ability to add in diversion routes, and to
        restructure the Data Model around fields and objects relating to
        provision, regulation and condition.

        The existing informational content of the existing legacy TROs in the UK
        is diverse, rich, and in some cases somewhat incompatible with a more
        limited, regularised approach defined in this specification for
        digitising traffic regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Data Model has been the subject of ongoing development, validation
        and piloting. It is not expected to be error-free or covering the full
        spectrum of TROs – but it is expected to support the digital encoding of
        a significant majority of TROs.

        This document is primarily intended to be read by technologists who are
        familiar with data modelling concepts, especially use of UML, as the
        contained diagrams are expressed in this notation format.
    </p>
    <p>
        As this specification evolves it is expected that additional context
        material will be made available to support ease of access to key
        concepts and principles for non-technical readers.

    </h2>
    <p>
        TROs are UK legislative instruments used by highways authorities to
        implement changes on the road network. They are used for such diverse
        purposes as:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       managing the use of the road with measures such as parking
        restrictions and speed limits,
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       allowing temporary closures for street parties and roadworks,
        and
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       experimental changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Innovations in transport and increasingly data-supported mobility are
        emerging. Foundational data, such as access to digital Traffic
        Regulation Measures, supports improved use of our transport
        infrastructure, forming an important element of this digital journey, to
        enhanced mobility services.
    </p>
    <p>
        The
        <strong>
            Local Transport Data Discovery
            Report<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><strong>[4]</strong></a>,
        </strong>
        published by DfT in 2018, explored the transport data held by Local
        Authorities. Its key findings relating to TROs were that:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       TRO data is difficult and time consuming to access, clean and
        process,
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       TRO data is not in a standardised, machine-readable format,
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       TROs lack of a centralised point of reference,
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Private sector organisations are being forced to collect TRO
        data manually, and
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      The current process for amending and implementing a TRO is labour
        intensive, time consuming, and costly.
    </p>
    <p>
        The report recommended that the DfT sponsor data projects which
        encourage and foster better local authority transport services,
        including streamlining and digitising TROs.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, several projects have followed, and in combination the
        development of this Data Model. These projects were as follows:

        </a>
        <strong></strong>(2019-20) [undertaken by PA Consulting] to identify
        improvements to the legislative process in England. Strongly recommended
        development of the TRO data model as a matter of priority.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through 2019-20 DfT worked with several local authorities to undertake a
        <strong>first validation of the TRO Data Model</strong> with 8 Local
        Authorities and market-leading solution providers.
    </p>
    <p>
        DfT commissioned the <strong>TRO Data Model Alpha</strong><em></em>[undertaken 
        by Valtech] (2020-21) giving recommendations on expected market
        deployment of the TRO data model, and how TRO data from LAs would be
        made available.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2021-22 there was further data model validation and enhancement using
        real-world <strong>Data Model Validation</strong> of TROs from four
        local authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2022 DfT undertook a <strong>Policy Consultation</strong> concerning
        the assessment of changes in TRO legislation.

        In 2023, Informed Solutions conducted a <strong>Service Alpha</strong>
        developing the 3.1.1 version of the Data Model and conducting
        pre-production Alpha testing with a small set of TRAs involved.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>D-TRO Beta project</strong> is currently underway, conducted
        by PA Consulting, with main updates on the Data Model proposed being the
        implementation of records management, live reporting of TTROs and
        enabling more effective location referencing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Automated Vehicles Act 2024</strong> (section 93) received
        Royal Assent in May 2024. It provides the capability for the Secretary
        of State through regulation to require TRAs to provide information on a
        defined set of TROs, in a specified manner and form, to be provided in
        accordance with a specified model, standard or set of specifications.

        <a name="_Toc190681340">2.1.    Background</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Data modelling is by its nature open to interpretation, different
        approaches and may reflect the personal preferences of those developing
        it.
    </p>
    <p>
        DfT agreed that the modelling approach would seek to achieve several
        aims:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       It provides as simple a structure as is possible to model a wide
        spectrum of traffic regulation concepts as is practicable
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Where appropriate, aligned to internationally recognised
        standards (see section 2.6).
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Based on an appropriate and relevant data structure.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Compatible with other standards where possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       As open and accessible as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        The management and exchange of traffic regulations and TROs is a
        strengthening need, that will support the digitisation of traffic,
        vehicle automation and enhanced data-centric transport and mobility
        services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Transport and mobility include both the short local and cross-border
        long-distance journey. There is a need to develop common national
        mechanisms to ensure the efficient and safe movement of vehicles and
        road users. Commonality is needed to support travel between
        jurisdictions, but also the consistent sharing and use of TRO data.
    </p>
    <p>
        At present, although international conventions support the free movement
        of road traffic and general conditions for safe common road use, and
        other road features such as common aspects of road signs, there are no
        existing common technical standards for how to encode and model road
        traffic regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Data Model is the first national recognised effort to support such
        encoding, expressly for the purpose of exchanging details concerning
        road traffic regulations, their location and features as well as the
        traffic impact that they create. The Data Model is expected to form part
        of the “with a specified model, standard or set of specifications”
        specifications as mentioned in the Automated Vehicles Act 2024, section
        93(8).
    </p>

        <a name="_Toc190681341">2.2.    General concepts</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
        TROs are complex and have been specified by highway authorities (and now
        TRAs) over an extended period, with quite some variation of style and
        approach. Developing the Data Model is challenging and therefore choices
        and simplifications are needed. The Data Model has been subject to
        modification and enhancement through a series of projects and also in
        response to comments and issues raised through validation undertaken by
        some Local Authorities and their existing TRO software service
        providers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Onward reviews and use of this model will identify omissions and
        exceptions, but the design principles adopted seek to provide clear data
        modelling constructs to cover a range of key concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
        When considering TROs there are various aspects that could be the
        subject of modelling:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The legal Order itself, as made by the TRA
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Road network features (instantiated by the Order) that control
        the movement of traffic, use of the highways, etc, which includes the
        modelling of the traffic effect of the regulation for that feature
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Modelling of road traffic signs
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Modelling of road markings and other traffic management measures
    </p>
    <p>
        DfT focus for the Data Model has been to develop a firm technical basis
        to support the encoding, exchange, storage and distribution of details
        of the legal contents of the TRO itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        The scope of the Data Model covers all different forms of Order
        (permanent, temporary, experimental and notices) for both moving and
        stationary traffic.
    </p>

        <a name="_Toc190681342">2.3.    Design principles</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The following design principles have reflected the shaping of the Data
        Model:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The scope of the Data Model shall cover all different forms of
        Order (permanent, temporary, experimental and notices) for both moving
        and stationary traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The Data Model will seek to include the full semantic contents
        of (a largely majority of) TROs. This notes that there is wide variety
        in the form and content of existing TROs, and attempting to model all
        content and options is both impractical and counter-productive to the
        intent of creating standardised digital TRO records based on a common
        data structure as defined by the Data Model.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The Data Model will seek to simplify data structures as much as
        practical.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The Data Model design will be cognisant of user needs in terms
        of provisioning of digital TRO records, the most likely use cases for
        consumption and reuse of digital TRO records, and supporting DfT policy
        objectives, as well as supporting automated validation.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Where appropriate, the Data Model will align and reuse concepts
        specified in appropriate European or International Standards.

        ●       The Data Model shall be extensible. The current landscape,
        format and content of ‘made’ TROs contains wide diversity. As part of
        the process of digitalising and regularising TRO information in the form
        of D-TRO records, it is essential to try to bound possible options and
        characteristics in an extensive, inclusive but ultimately limited way.
        It is important to provide technical mechanisms within the structure of
        the Data Model and its implementation in the D-TRO service to enable
        some of the key vocabulary to be extended in an ad-hoc user driven way.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is a matter of service governance that use of the extension
        mechanism, mentioned above, should only be used when absolutely
        necessary. This will ensure that the consistency of the collected set of
        D-TRO records is maintained. However, legitimate need to extend values
        beyond the ‘hard coded’ values in the Data Model is essential. Regular
        use of extended items should raise the need for their consideration of
        inclusion in a revision of the Data Model – as part of the expected
        regime of the Data Model governance.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The Data Model shall be designed and represented in a manner
        that aligns with Government policies and is portable, and suitable for
        long term maintenance.

    </h2>
    <p>
        As reflected in the design principles, above, ongoing work is reviewing
        user needs for digital TRO records, and therefore the foreseen
        deployment of the D-TRO Service and the Data Model.
    </p>
    <p>
        This section does not seek to replicate the wide spectrum of needs but
        highlights a handful of considerations that shape the way in which the
        Data Model is expected to be used.
    </p>
    <p>
        DfT, through the previous Service Alpha and current Beta Project, are
        reviewing and enhancing user needs analysis, prototyping the D-TRO
        Service, and reviewing the Data Model. Therefore, updates and changes
        may occur.
    </p>
    <p>
        The DfT’s preferred option is to establish a centralised service which
        receives digital TROs (D-TROs) from TRAs, stores these records, and
        exposes data services for consumers to request distribution of D-TRO
        records. The Data Model forms the technical baseline for D-TRO records.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to the variety of different forms of TRO and notices permitted under
        the legislation, there is a need to define in future legislation and
        statutory guidance when in the lifecycle of orders and notices the TRA
        will be required to provide a D-TRO record to the D-TRO Service. The
        current expectation is that the following Reporting Points are needed –
        see Figure 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a name="_Ref135989907">Figure</a> 2 – D-TRO Reporting Points
        (Provisional)
    </p>
    <p>
        These Reporting Points are reflected in the Data Model in an enumerated
        list named
        ‘orderReportingPointType’<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is not foreseen that the D-TRO Central Service will in the future
        retain a full, growing library of all D-TROs submitted over time, but
        retain recently submitted D-TRO records and those that remain current.
        The Service is also expected to hold future D-TRO records, and those
        that have recently expired, or replaced by a newer amended version, or
        revoked. The precise definition of this Service is currently being
        defined through this Beta project, with initial version for a records
        management capability being implemented.

        The Data Model has been modelled in UML (Unified Modelling Language)
        following Model Driven Architecture design principles. Sparx Systems

        This will allow users who have Enterprise Architect software to directly
        open, view, modify, and work with the model in the same environment it
        was created. An XMI extract is also provided to allow import of the Data
        Model into other modelling tools or software applications that support

        Alignment with other standards
    </h2>
    <p>
        This document and the Data Model reuse some well-known, widely deployed
        model fragments that appear in several European and International
        standards:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The “Condition” sub-model is specified in both “TN-ITS”
        CEN/TS17268:2018 and “APDS” ISO/TS 5206-1:2023,
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The “TimeValidity” sub-model is an adaptation of “TimeValidity”
        package specified in “DATEX II” CEN/TS 16157-7:2018,
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The “VehicleCharacteristics” sub-model specified in “DATEX II”
        CEN/TS 16157-7:2018,
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The “Rates” sub-model is specified in “APDS” ISO/TS 5206-1:2023.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the Data Model has been reviewed for application in the UK, and
        in some cases the values appearing in the lists contained the Data Model
        have been adjusted with additions, deletions and adjustments when
        compared to the Standards content.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Data Model supports conditions that relate to the vehicle type,
        vehicle usage, vehicle dimensions, fuel type, etc. These condition lists
        were reviewed from the viewpoint of normal practice in the UK by
        experienced practitioners. This has resulted in a profiling of these
        condition types and lists that are more suitable for current UK
        practice.

        Location Referencing
    </h2>
    <p>
        One of the technical aspects within the D-TRO Beta Data Specification
        which requires further clarification and resolution, is how to
        systematically encode information relating to the spatial location and
        positioning used within TROs. Currently, an approach has been proposed
        to shape the data structures that are needed to support it within the
        D-TRO Beta Data Specification and its Data Model.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to make future digital TROs useable to the widest set of
        stakeholders and applications the provision of a coded location that is
        machine-interpretable and can be related to specific spatially coded
        locations on digital maps is considered essential.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following stakeholder comment, DfT has revised the proposed recommended
        approach. Given the need to reduce barriers to uptake during the D-TRO
        Beta project phase, no singular preferred approach is mandated.
        Therefore, for example, a speed limit TRO provision can be represented
        either by linear road centreline/reference line features (polyline) or
        by use of a polygon. Similarly, kerb line regulations can be represented
        as a polyline, a polygon or both. This approach will be reviewed during
        the D-TRO Beta project, taking on board feedback primarily from data
        consumers concerning the useability of mixed approach data.
    </p>
    <p>
        DfT prefers the use of polygons, but these are not mandatory.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some forms of TRO do require special treatment to ensure that the data
        can be correctly interpreted. This special treatment applies to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Gate/point locations
        </li>
        <li>
            Directional regulations (such as no entry, one-way streets, turning
            movements, etc.)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There is a need to provide clear guidance and a common approach to
        enable TRAs to code TRO locations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Single consolidated or other TROs may represent a range of measures
        (Provisions) impacting different locations – this approach should
        support TRAs identifying and encoding “regulated place” in a manner that
        they consider appropriate. The approach aims to limit specific coding
        rules to a practical minimum, enabling both alignment with the more
        commonly used existing practice whilst counter-balancing use of a
        limited number of coding mechanisms which will aid greater commonality
        and interoperability of data.
    </p>
    <p>
        In general, if a TRO regulation is identified as being effective at two
        or more distinct locations, each location should be treated as a
        separate "regulated place", as laid out in the D-TRO Data Specification.
        The design approach aims to address the wide spectrum of different forms
        of shape that TRO regulations can take.
    </p>
    <p>
        The standardised approach:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            should not be tied to a specific form of reference base map data
            set.
        </li>
        <li>
            shall use a widely understood and supported standardised data
            format.
        </li>
        <li>
            should be cognisant of the level of effort required to achieve it.
        </li>
        <li>
            should support the needs of identified use cases, so far as these
            are defined.
        </li>
        <li>
            should separate the principles of what is being encoded, from the
            actual IT-centric coding mechanism itself.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The D-TRO Beta Data Specification uses of The OSGB36 / British National
        Grid Coordinate Reference System (ESPG:27700).  In the current D-TRO
        Private Beta Data Specification the Well-Known Text (WKT) geometry
        standard - ISO/IEC 13249-3:2016 shall be used for the encoding of
        geometric coordinates.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is no support in the D-TRO Beta Data Specification to enable the
        upload of scan or electronic version of TROs, schedules, or associated
        maps.

    </h2>
    <p>
        The transition to digital TROs necessitates the standardisation of terms
        and definitions to ensure consistency, interoperability, and clarity
        across different TRAs and platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Standardisation becomes increasingly important to ensure consistency and
        interoperability by facilitating a uniform understanding of traffic
        regulations across various regions and platforms. This uniformity is
        essential for the development of interoperable digital systems that can
        communicate and integrate seamlessly. For instance, a term like
        "no-stopping" (kerbsideNoStopping) should have a universally accepted
        definition to avoid discrepancies between different technology providers
        used by TRAs, navigation systems, and other traffic management
        applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clear and consistent definitions in digital TROs help in maintaining
        legal clarity. Inconsistent or ambiguous terms can lead to
        misinterpretation of the regulations, resulting in legal challenges and
        non-compliance.  With D-TROs also supporting the rise of intelligent
        transport systems, automated vehicles, and advanced navigation aids,
        this depends heavily on the availability of standardised digital
        information. For these technologies to function correctly and interact
        with human drivers and existing infrastructure, they need access to
        precise and consistent regulatory data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recognising the critical need for standardisation, an assessment is
        currently underway to collate and analyse the varied uses of terms
        across different sources relevant to TROs. This comprehensive assessment
        involves examining the language used in existing TRO documents from
        multiple authorities, reviewing legislative texts, and consulting with
        stakeholders in the Transport Technology Forum and wider. The goal is to
        identify inconsistencies and ambiguities in the current terminologies
        and to propose a harmonised set of definitions that can be adopted
        universally.

    <p>
        As you work through this user guide you will see attributes that are
        specified in the different objects are assigned specific data types.
        These help a developer know the whether the attribute gains its
        potential values from the entries in an enumerated list (such as
        vehicleType), or is a date, a date-time, a web address (URI – a
        Universal Resource Identifier), string (for free text), etc.

    <p>
        The Data Model is specified using a convention Unified Modelling
        Language (UML). From this model we generate a JSON (JavaScript Notation)
        schema which provide the template for exchangeable structured data.

    <p>
        In a limited number of cases the data type shown in the Data Model is

    <p>
        This section provides a tour of the main features of the Data Model.
    </p>
    <p>
        Figure 3 shows a summarised simplified view of the main structures of
        the Data Model. These structures often contain more detailed sub-models,
        which are detailed later in this section.
    </p>
    <p>
        One way to think of the organisation of the information is that each
        Digital TRO record (D-TRO record) contains the information contained in
        one TRO. Each D-TRO record needs to contain information on the ‘what’,
        ‘where’, ‘when’, and ‘who’ concepts. The ‘who’ concept is covered by
        what conditions apply, and what exemptions or exclusions exist. For TROs
        that incur a form of payment or charging, the 'how much' concept can
        also be expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
        As denoted in Figure 3, these concepts are held within different
        structures.

        – Object view of high-level TRO concepts
    </p>
    <p>
        Each TRO will be characterised by one D-TRO record. In other words, all
        the informational detail of one TRO should be contained in one D-TRO
        record.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: There is a set of metadata attributes that contain information on
        when the D-TRO record was published by the TRA or their software service
        provider, and the identity of the publishing entity. These metadata
        elements form part of the exchange mechanism itself and sit beyond the
        contents of the Data Model, forming part of the schema used for
        exchange. Details of these metadata attributes are provided in the Data
        Specification’s Interface Control Documents.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Source</strong> object contains basic information concerning
        which TRA which created this TRO, the TRA which is the current owner of
        the TRO, the TRAs that are affected by the TRO. The formal published
        name of the TRO is also supported.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, <strong>Source</strong> permits linking to any other
        digitised TRO that is referenced within this TRO. The cross reference is
        the unique D-TRO record identifier ID, not a textual name of a TRO.
    </p>
    <p>
        In each D-TRO record, it is possible to define one or many Source
        objects, with each Source object being related to one section or clause
        in the TRO.

    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Source</strong> object defines several mandatory attributes.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The ‘troName’ attribute</strong> is the cited name of the
        Traffic Regulation Order (TRO) as defined by the Traffic Regulation
        Authority (TRA). The data type is a (free text) String. This attribute
        is mandatory and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The ‘section’ attribute</strong> indicates the clause,
        schedule, or article defined by the TRA where the related Provisions can
        be located. The data type is a (free text) String. This attribute is
        mandatory and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The ‘actionType’ attribute</strong> indicates the action type
        to be carried out by the source, with a ‘reference’ ID provided to link
        to the current source on which the action is being executed. The data
        type is ActionType (enumeration). Possible values are shown in Figure 6.
        This attribute is mandatory and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The ‘actionType’ attribute</strong> indicates the action type
        to be carried out by the source, with a ‘reference’ ID provided to link
        to the current source on which the action is being executed. The data
        type is ActionType (enumeration). Possible values are shown in Figure 6.
        This attribute is mandatory and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The ‘reference’ attribute</strong> is a unique identifier for
        each instance of a Source by originating TRA. The precise format of the
        reference is not prescribed and is left to the discretion of the data
        supplier. It is, however, mandatory and shall be unique for the
        originating TRA. The data type is a (free text) String. This attribute
        is required and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The ‘comingIntoForceDate’ attribute</strong> specifies the
        date on which the TRO comes into legal effect. The data type is a date.
        This attribute is required and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The ‘currentTraOwner’ attribute</strong> identifies the
        current Traffic Regulation Authority responsible for maintaining this
        D-TRO. The value should correspond to a SWA-like authority code. The
        data type is an integer. This attribute is required and must be provided
        exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The ‘madeDate’ attribute</strong> indicates the date that the
        TRO was made, if applicable. The data type is a date. This attribute is
        optional.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The ‘statementDescription’ attribute</strong> provides a
        description of the overall nature of the prohibition, regulation, or
        restriction imposed by the TRO. The data type is a (free text) String.
        This attribute is optional and may appear multiple times if needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The ‘traAffected’ attribute</strong> identifies the Traffic
        Regulation Authorities whose roads are affected by this D-TRO. The value
        should correspond to one or more SWA-like codes. The data type is an
        integer. At least one entry is required.
    </p>
    <p>
        ● <strong>The ‘traCreator’ attribute</strong> identifies the Highway
        Regulation Authority that created the D-TRO. The value should be a
        SWA-like code. The data type is an integer. This attribute is mandatory
        and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a name="_Ref168310838">Figure</a>6 - Enumeration values for actionType
    </p>
    <p>
        The actionType attribute specifies the type of action being taken with
        respect to a specific version of a D-TRO. It is used to indicate how the
        current version relates to any earlier version(s) of the same Traffic
        Regulation Order. The data type is a string constrained to a defined set
        of controlled vocabulary values. This attribute is mandatory and must be
        provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        Permitted values include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>new</strong> – Indicates that the supplied D-TRO version is
            entirely new and not an amendment of any earlier version.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>fullAmendment</strong> – Indicates that the supplied version
            fully replaces and amends an earlier version of the D-TRO.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>partialAmendment</strong> – Indicates that the supplied
            version partially amends an earlier version of the D-TRO.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>fullRevoke</strong> – Indicates that the D-TRO is fully
            revoked in its entirety.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>partialRevoke</strong> – Indicates that the D-TRO is
            partially revoked, affecting only certain elements of the earlier
            version.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>noChange</strong> – Indicates that the supplied version does
            not introduce any changes from the previous D-TRO version.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>errorFix</strong> – Indicates that the current version
            corrects one or more errors present in an earlier version.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>amendment</strong> – A general indicator that the current
            version introduces amendments to a prior version, where the specific
            nature of amendment (full or partial) is not further detailed.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This classification allows systems and users to track the evolution of
        legal traffic regulations and their current applicability in a
        structured and machine-readable way.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Source</strong> object also contains three additional
        mandatory attributes, which may be subject to change due to on-going
        design considerations:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The ‘traCreator’ attribute gives the code for the TRA that
        created the Order or Notice.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The ‘traCurrentOwner’ attribute gives the code for the TRA that
        is the current responsible party for the Order or Notice.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The ‘traAffected’ attribute identifies, by use of the code, one
        or several TRAs whose roads are subject to the Provisions of the Order
        or Notice. This is an array of integer values. Note: in this version,
        this includes the creating TRA. This may be changed in future versions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The codes will be defined is a manner similar to the SWA codes used for
        street works. These attributes allow the tracing of the original creator
        and current responsible TRA owner and also those TRAs affected – this
        supports where boundary changes, authority name changes, etc. It will be
        quite common for all three attributes to identify the same TRA where no
        significant changes have occurred, and the TRO content relates only to
        the originating TRA’s road network.
    </p>
    <p>
        We then move on to the <strong>Provision</strong> object. Provisions are
        an important concept – each instance of Provision represents
        specifically one type of <strong>Regulation</strong>, subject to one set
        of homogeneous conditions (conditions, exemptions, and times of
        applicability, and, if applicable, tariff rates), that are relevant to
        one or several <strong>RegulatedPlace</strong>(s).
    </p>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

            <tr>

                        Example: A Traffic Regulation Authority defines in a TRO
                        regulation indicating both a changed speed limit,
                        introduction of a new bus lane and kerbside parking and
                        waiting regulations in the same street location.  These
                        would be, at least, three distinct Provisions.

                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        Within each TRO, multiple Sources may be defined; with each Source
        object being related to one section or clause in the TRO.
    </p>
    <p>
        Related to each Source object, multiple Provision objects may be
        defined. Each instance of <strong>Provision</strong> shall be related to
        one instance of <strong>Regulation.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The relationship between the objects Provision, RegulatedPlace and
        Regulation is shown in Figure 7.

        of the Provision, RegulatedPlace and Regulation objects
    </p>
    <p>
        By way of illustration, consider one TRO that contains two Provisions.
        The first Provision is, say, a kerbside parking place regulation,
        regulated to be applicable 24 hours, 7 days per week, relevant to
        locations A, B and C. The second Provision is, say, a kerbside loading
        place regulation, regulated to be useable between 06:00 am and 08:00 on
        weekdays, limited to commercial vehicles, relevant to locations D and F.

        Provision Object
    </p>
    <p>
        The Provision object defines several mandatory attributes.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      The ‘actionType’ attribute indicates the action to be carried out
        by the Provision, with a ‘reference’ ID provided to link to the current
        Provision the action is being carried out on. See section 3.2. The data
        type is ActionType (enumeration). This attribute is mandatory and must
        be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      The ‘comingIntoForceDate’ attribute specifies the date on which
        the Provision comes into legal effect. The data type is date. This
        attribute is mandatory and must be provided exactly once. <br/>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      The ‘expectedOccupancyDuration’ attribute specifies the expected
        duration (in integer days) of the Provision’s occupancy. The data type
        is duration. This attribute is optional, but recommended where relevant
        to the type of regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      The ‘orderReportingPoint’ attribute indicates at which of the
        recognised Reporting Points this Provision instance rests. Reporting
        Points are described in more detail in section 2.4. The data type is
        OrderReportingPointType (enumeration). This attribute is mandatory and
        must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      The ‘provisionDescription’ attribute provides a free text
        description of the referenced Provision. The data type is a string (free
        text). This attribute is mandatory and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      The ‘reference’ attribute is a unique identifier for each
        instance of a Provision by the originating TRA. The precise format of
        the reference is not prescribed and is left to the discretion of the
        data supplier. It is, however, mandatory and shall be unique for the
        originating TRA. The data type is a string (free text). This attribute
        is required and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Provision class may also be extended by either an
        ExperimentalVariation or an ExperimentalCessation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Figure 9 – UML model representation of the Extension of the Provision
        Object
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            An <strong>ExperimentalVariation</strong> describes a planned change
            in regulatory effect, including the effectOfChange and an
            expectedDuration in days.
        </li>
        <li>
            An <strong>ExperimentalCessation</strong> defines the end of a
            provision under an experimental context, including the
            actualDateOfCessation and the natureOfCessation.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This model supports both permanent and time-bound experimental
        regulations, ensuring flexibility in managing regulatory states and
        their lifecycle within a traffic order.
    </p>
    <p>
        Figure 10 – UML model representation of the ExperimentalVariation object
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>ExperimentalVariation</strong> class is a JSON element used
        to define the characteristics of a variation applied to an Experimental
        Traffic Regulation Order (Experimental Order). This class captures both
        the nature and duration of the variation, enabling detailed
        documentation and structured data handling of experimental regulatory
        changes.
    </p>

        The <strong>ExperimentalCessation</strong>class is a JSON element used
        to define the characteristics of a cessation applied to an Experimental
        Traffic Regulation Order (Experimental Order). This class enables the
        structured recording of the end of an experimental regulatory provision,
        including both the cessation date and its rationale.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is associated with a Provision that was enacted under experimental
        powers and has since been formally ceased, either upon conclusion of its
        intended trial period or for other operational or legal reasons.

    </p>
    <p>
        Each instance of <strong>Provision</strong> shall be related to one
        instance of <strong>Regulation</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each <strong>Regulation</strong> object defines one and only one form of
        regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regulations fall into one of four categories:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       SpeedLimitValueBased – which are speed limit regulations based
        upon a declared speed limit. As the default speed limit for well-lit
        streets may not be 30 mph, it is necessary to define the value alongside
        the speedLimitValueType enum.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       SpeedLimitProfileBased – which are based on speed limit
        regulations. For example, one profile is
        ‘nationalSpeedLimitDualCarriageway’, others are
        ‘nationalSpeedLimitSingleCarriageway’ and ‘nationalSpeedLimitMotorway’.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       GeneralRegulation – characterising a wider range of regulations
        – see later for further details.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       OffListRegulation – which characterises an extension mechanism
        for a TRA to declare a form of Regulation that is not otherwise covered
        by the regulations specified in the first two categories.

        The <strong>Regulation</strong> object defines two mandatory attributes.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The ‘isDynamic’ attribute indicates whether the Regulation
        identified is dynamic in nature (i.e., the Regulation is triggered by
        some condition – for example, changeable speed limits, access
        regulations, or triggered by environment conditions). The value ‘True’
        indicates the Regulation is dynamic in nature; ‘False’ indicates the
        Regulation is static.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The ‘timeZone’ attribute enables the time zone applicable to the
        Regulation to be defined. This is important in supporting the management
        of the definition of clearly specified times that work appropriately in
        local time zones. The time zone is specified IANA time zone (see
        <a href="http://www.iana.org/time-zones">
            http://www.iana.org/time-zones

        Note: It is acknowledged that existing practice for defining TROs in
        different TRAs may use slightly different terms to describe what
        fundamentally are the same regulatory concept. To improve the
        interoperability of TRO data coming from different TRAs, mapping of
        locally adopted terms to the regulation types given in the list above is
        essential. Genuinely new, distinct regulation concepts can be provided
        using the OffListRegulation mechanism described below – but this should
        be rarely used.

        ●       The <strong>SpeedLimitValueBased</strong>object defines a speed
        limit value using structured attributes. It includes two mandatory and
        one optional attribute, as described below
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The ‘type’ attribute indicates the type of speed limit being
        defined. The possible values are
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       maximumSpeedLimit
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       minimumSpeedLimit
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       nationalSpeedLimitWellLitStreetDefault <br/>
        The data type is SpeedLimitValueType (enumeration). This attribute is
        mandatory and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The ‘mphValue’ attribute gives the integer value of the speed
        limit being applied, expressed in miles per hour (mph). The data type is
        integer. This attribute is mandatory and must be provided exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The ‘nature’ attribute specifies the nature of the speed limit,
        such as whether it is advisory, mandatory, or temporary. The data type
        is SpeedLimitNatureType (enumeration). This attribute is optional but
        recommended for clarity.

    <p>
        The <strong>SpeedLimitProfileBased</strong> object has one mandatory
        attribute.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The ‘type’ attribute indicates the type of profile for speed
        limit being defined for Carriageways and Motorways, with potential
        values: ‘nationalSpeedLimitDualCarriageway’,
        ‘nationalSpeedLimitSingleCarriageway’ and ‘nationalSpeedLimitMotorway’.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Data Model is experimental in nature and there is a real-world road
        network usage and therefore TROs (e.g., consider the relatively recent
        introduction of e-Scooters). The Data Model supports a couple of
        different approaches to support extension to new situations and
        regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a new form of regulation is required, beyond those already specified
        in the Data Model, the <strong>OffListRegulation</strong> object can be
        used.

        Object.

        The OffListRegulation object has three attributes:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The mandatory ‘regulationShortName’ attribute enables the TRA to
        give a short name for the new extended regulation type. This typically
        is less than 30 characters in length. For example,
        “kerbsideEScooterParking” or “kerbsidePublicMobileRobotParking”.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The mandatory ‘regulationFullText’ attribute contains the full
        descriptive text used in the TRO for the new extended regulation type.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Optionally, multiple references to the new extended regulation
        may be provided. This may be a reference to a clause in the TRO or a
        Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to supporting published material.
    </p>
    <p>
        In instances where a temporary regulation temporarily replaces a
        pre-existing regulation the <strong>TemporaryRegulation</strong> object
        may be used to indicate references to pre-existing regulation(s).

                            come into the D-TRO Central Service, particularly in
                            the case of amendments, revocations, variations by
                            notice and consolidations.

    <p>
        As part of records management, the Central Service will maintain a “live
        TRO” list, which may be modified by the receipt of a new inbound Order
        or Notice received by the Central Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      An <strong>Amendment</strong> Order can change or remove anything
        in an existing order – or orders – and add new provisions and revoke
        other orders.
    </p>
    <p>
        •    A revocation is a type of amendment order, that does not have any
        new provisions. An order that only contains revocations will still be
        advertised and consulted upon. The receipt of a record that is
        identified solely as a revocation into the central service, does not
        automatically mean that any referenced previous orders will be removed
        from the “live TRO” list. An order that is solely a revocation may only
        revoke parts of an old order and leave other parts intact – this may be
        a partial revocation of a Provision within a previous TRO.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      Parking tariffs are varied by use of a
        <strong>
            variation by notice
        </strong>
        . As the initial tariffs may have been specified in the original full
        order, this can have the effect of being an amendment to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      A <strong>consolidation</strong> is an administrative process and
        nothing ‘of substance’ should be added or removed. Generally, a
        consolidation would combine a base order and its subsequent amendments
        into a new base order. If something is missed from the revocation list
        of a consolidation, then the remaining pre-existing Provisions (partial
        or whole) might be orphaned but still be in force. These always have
        multiple revocations by definition.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      A <strong>consolidation</strong> can be used to change some
        details of a previously made TRO, so long as this does not affect the
        substance of the Order. Things can be tidied up if required (noting
        there is small defined list of minor changes that are allowed) but
        nothing should be changed that would ordinarily require consultation.
        The opportunity to make changes is very limited. However, as a side
        note, this can be complicated by the fact that some people refer to the
        combination of old orders with substantial changes as a consolidation,
        which it is not.
    </p>
    <p>
        We require that all (versions of) Orders and Notices received shall
        contain “minimum contextual content” (i.e. the who, what, when and how
        much, if relevant, of any Provision). This requirement is defined by the
        minimum mandatory data elements within the Data Model. Effectively new
        versions will replace older versions within the Live TRO list – old
        versions will remain visible for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whilst the central service currently will hold records for all D-TRO
        records it has received, D-TRO records management mean that new versions
        of TROs (and their Provisions) – through amendments and revocations –
        will supersede earlier versions. Each version is considered to be a
        complete representation of the TRO and its Provisions. Older records
        that have been amended or revoked will be visible in the Central Service
        for a defined retention period, before being archived.

        The Source and Provision objects have been described above in section
        3.1, with an illustrative example shown in Figure 17.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a name="_Ref183457899">Figure</a>17 – Records Management Example for
        Source &amp; Provision
    </p>
    <p>
        The example shown above illustrates the D-TROs records management in
        progress. The left-hand side shows a new TRO, being submitted as a D-TRO
        into the central service (via the “Create D-TRO” process).
    </p>
    <p>
        It contains multiple Sources and Provisions. For the purpose of this
        illustration, we focus on Source #1 (with reference TRAxxxx-So-01, and
        actionType = 'new'). It has two child Provisions:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      Provision #1 with Reference: TRAxxxx-Pro-01 and actionType =
        'new', and
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      Provision #2 with Reference: TRAxxxx-Pro-12 and actionType =
        'new'
    </p>
    <p>
        At a later point in time, the TRA makes a new (Consolidation) TRO with
        Reference TRAxxxx-SO-09, and actionType = 'Amendment’.  We highlight two
        of the provisions in the example:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      Provision #1, with Reference: TRAxxxx-Pro-01 and actionType =
        ‘partialAmendment’, and
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      Provision #7, with Reference: TRAxxxx-Pro-12 and actionType =
        ‘fullRevoke’
    </p>
    <p>
        For the new Provision #1, as this has the same reference as Provision #1
        from the earlier TRO, and an action type of ‘partialAmendment’, this
        instance of the Provision is considered to fully replace the earlier
        instance. The old version of Provision #1 with Reference: TRAxxxx-Pro-01
        will be marked in the D-TRO Service database as not current and replaced
        by a newer version.
    </p>
    <p>
        For Provision #7, as this has the same reference as Provision #2 from
        the earlier TRO, and an action type of ‘fullRevoke’, this instance of
        the Provision is considered to fully replace the earlier instance. The
        old version of Provision #2 with Reference: TRAxxxx-Pro-12 will be
        marked in the D-TRO Service database as not current.
    </p>
    <p>
        When using actionType’s for Amendment (‘fullAmendment’ or
        ‘partialAmendment’) the old Provision (or Source is considered to be
        fully replaced by the new Provision. The same applies to amendment of
        Sources. The distinction between ‘fullAmendment’ and ‘partialAmendment’
        does not change the action of the D-TRO service records management, but
        rather may be helpful metadata for data consumers to correctly interpret
        updates between records. The same records management approach applies to
        ‘partialRevoke’.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use of ‘fullyRevoke’ does not replace the older record by a newer one,
        but rather triggers the older record to be marked in the D-TRO Service
        database as not current.
    </p>
    <p>
        The use of the actionType ‘new’ is interpreted by the D-TRO service as
        the newer records being unrelated to older records. Both will be
        considered to be current in the D-TRO Service database.

        In order to make future digital TROs useable to the widest set of
        stakeholders and applications the provision of a coded location that is
        machine-interpretable and can be related to specific spatially coded
        locations on digital maps is considered essential. Providing clear
        information on the geographic spatial location that are subject to
        regulations is a critical element of the D-TRO record.
    </p>
    <p>
        No single preferred approach is mandated at this current stage.
        Therefore, for example, a speed limit TRO provision can be represented
        either by linear road centreline/reference line features (polyline) or
        by use of a polygon. Similarly, kerb line regulations can be represented
        as a polyline, a polygon or both.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following sections lay out a standardised approach for how the
        location data for TRO regulations should be handled. All TRO regulation
        measures shall be defined geospatially, using coordinates and coded in
        WKT (Well Known Text) format.
    </p>
    <p>
        The standardised approach covers general concepts, such as where to
        place spatial polygons or polyline in different circumstances, which is
        expected to be appropriate for most forms of TRO regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The standardised approach addresses:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      Instances where TRO regulations are subject to a direction, such
        as one-way streets, no entry restrictions, banned turns, etc
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      Cases where TRO regulations may apply to roads that appear
        coincident on a map but are grade separated vertically.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      The topic of providing additional contextual information that
        enables the TRO regulation locations to be associated directly with
        references found in well-known road network model data sets,
        specifically the National Street Gazetteer.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●      Other forms of TRO regulation location which can be considered
        more point-like, such as gate access regulations, some height, width,
        weight regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
        A TRO may contain multiple distinct regulations (measures) which relate
        to potentially numerous Regulated Places. The shape/geometry of the
        spatial footprint of a Regulated Place may not be well defined in
        existing and current new TROs. Table 1 provides an overview of the forms
        of shape/geometry for TRO regulations.

        A <strong>RegulatedPlace</strong> represents a real-world identifiable
        location which is where the Provision and related Regulation(s) are
        applicable to. There is no particular limitation or rules concerning
        specifying a RegulatedPlace, or choosing to define the zone of influence
        into several RegulatedPlace – this is a choice of the TRA.

        If multiple Geometry instances exist for a RegulatedPlace each Geometry
        instance represents an alternative version (alternative representation)

                            use of a LinearGeometry object, and associated
                            ExternalReferences (USRNs). A DirectedLinear object
                            could also be used.  The Geometry and PointLocation
                            objects should not be used.

        Each RegulatedPlace has a description given in a free-text string in the
        ‘description’ attribute. This can support the traditional textual
        description of the relevant location (e.g. Henbury Way).
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, the ‘type’ attribute indicates whether the RegulatedPlace
        instance defines the location of the effect of the regulation
        (regulationLocation) or a diversion route (diversionRoute).
    </p>
    <p>

        Each <strong>RegulatedPlace</strong> is linked to at least one, and
        potentially more than one, <strong>Geometry</strong> object.

        The details provided in the Geometry object alone are not sufficient to
        define the spatial geometry of the RegulatedPlace and provide meaningful
        semantic content to explain what the given geometry means. Therefore,
        four specialisations of different forms of geometry are supported.
    </p>
    <p>
        The four specialisations are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            PointGeometry – where the supplied geometry identifies a point
            location, the context of this point location is given in the
            PointGeometry object.
        </li>
        <li>
            LinearGeometry – where the supplied geometry identifies a polyline
            location, the context of this polyline (linear location) is given in
            the LinearGeometry object.
        </li>
        <li>
            Polygon – where the supplied geometry identifies polygon (zone or
            area) location, the context of this polygon location is given in the
            Polygon object.
        </li>
        <li>
            DirectedLinear – where the supplied geometry a defined movement
            between two (or linked multiple more) locations (such as defining a
            banned turn between North Way and East Street), the context of
            motion (directed linear location) is given in the DirectedLinear
            object.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Each is described in turn.

        The use of the PointGeometry class is preferred for point / gate
        locations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The PointGeometry object has a single mandatory attribute,
        ‘representation’ which indicates the nature of the point location for a
        point representation of a regulated place. Acceptable values are:
        ‘centreLinePoint’, ‘trafficSignLocation’, and ‘other’.

        Note: the data type of the attribute “point” is defined as a string.

        model representation of the LinearGeometry Object
    </p>
    <p>
        The LinearGeometry object has four attributes:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The mandatory ‘representation’ attribute which identifies where
        the given linear geometry is represents a linear feature location (e.g.,
        a stretch of kerbline) and is a representation of zonal object (e.g.,
        the reference centreline of a length of road, where the location of
        applicability is the whole width of the road for the defined length).
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The mandatory ‘direction’ attribute indicates the direction of
        the applicability of the referenced regulation. Acceptable values are:
        ‘bidirectional’, ‘startToEnd’, and ‘endToStart’. Note this can be used
        to support the definition of the direction of a direction sensitive
        regulation on, say, a single road section (e.g. a northbound direction
        {from the start to the end of the sequence of vertices that exists
        within the polyline} on a one-way street).
    </p>
    <p>
        This is distinct from trying to define turning motions between two
        identifiable road sections. For a LinearLocation, the mandatory link to
        the National Street Gazetteer shall be used to supply all relevant URSN,
        if they exist. For a DirectedLinear requires reference to a start and an
        end USRN (i.e. two).
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The mandatory ‘lateralPosition’ attribute indicates the lateral
        position across a road of the linear representation of a regulated
        place. Acceptable values are: ‘centreline’, ‘onKerb’, and ‘near’ and
        ‘far’. The values near and far are not currently defined in any detail!
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The mandatory ‘linestring’ attribute is a free text field
        holding the WKT coded representation of vertices forming a linestring.
        By default, two coordinate values per vertex are used, however and
        optional third attribute can be defined in instances where the vertical
        separation of roads and regulations need to be defined.

    <p>
        The Polygon object has one attribute:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The mandatory ‘polygon’ defines a coordinate-polygon that
        represents the extent of the road subject to the TRO regulation. The
        mandatory ‘polygon’ attribute is a free text field holding the WKT-coded
        representation of vertices forming a polygon. By default, two coordinate
        values per vertex are used, however and optional third attribute can be
        defined in instances where the vertical separation of roads and

    <p>
        The DirectedLinear object has one attribute:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The mandatory ‘directedLineString’ specialisation is used for
        specifying regulations for turning movements or directional regulations.
        The mandatory ‘directedLineString’ attribute is a free text field
        holding the WKT-coded representation of vertices forming a polyline. In
        this case, the sequence of vertices defined is considered to be
        significant, the first vertex being considered the start of the
        directedLineString; and the last vertex being considered the end of the
        directedLineString. Intermediate additional vertices can be added if
        they are considered to clarify routing through the road network, between
        the start and the end. By default, two coordinate values per vertex are
        used, however and optional third attribute can be defined in instances
        where the vertical separation of roads and regulations need to be
        defined.

        The UniqueStreetReferenceNumber object has three attributes:

    <p>
        ●       The mandatory ‘nsgStreetName’ and ‘nsgSteetNumber’ are the
        street name and street reference numbers in the Gazetteer for the
        Regulated Place. ‘nsgStreetName’ and ‘nsgSteetNumber’ attributes are

        Use of each object and its attributes is given below.

    <p>
        For all dates and times, the following should be noted:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       All times are expressed in local time (i.e. without reference to
        UTC time-zone offset). The combination of the Regulation.timezone
        attribute and local times enables data consumers to calculate the times
        of applicability in absolute times. The rationale for specifying times
        of applicability in local times aligns with common practice for TROs and
        reduces the complexity of the data to be delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Dates and times – generally all date and time records shall be
        expressed using the ISO 8601-1:2019 extended format (e.g.,
        YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MI:SS) – note: no Z time zone offset. Some specific
        exceptions to this rule do exist – eventTime and publicationTime, which
        are both metadata attributes (beyond the scope of this document) are
        specified using the ISO 8601-1:2019 extended format for UTC datetimes,
        indicated by the suffix “Z” (e.g., YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MI:SSZ).

    <p>
        The TimeValidity object defines overall dates and times relating to the
        applicability of a Regulation. It shall be used to specify the bounding
        start and end times of the validity period, within which there may be
        any number of valid and invalid (exception) periods. The ‘start’ date
        time attribute is mandatory – in the case where the D-TRO record
        characterises a historic, live regulation and the actual date and time
        of applicability is unknown the start attribute should be set to the
        current time.
    </p>
    <p>
        For permanent TROs the end attribute may be omitted.
    </p>
    <p>
        The TimeValidity model allows intermittent or variable patterns of time
        applicability for TRO regulations to be specified.
    </p>
    <p>
        Figure 31 shows the UML class representation of the Period Object, but
        also note the two links at the top of the figure, which allow instances
        of the Period object to be specified either as a valid period (i.e., an
        included period) or an exception period (i.e., an excluded period where
        the regulation is not applicable).
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: it is a matter of data quality and integrity on behalf of the data
        supplier to ensure the dates and times and periods of applicability are
        complete, consistent and coherent – there is nothing in the Data Model
        per se that stops contradictory or conflicting information being
        specified. Data suppliers should take appropriate steps to ensure the
        quality of the data supplied.
    </p>
    <p>
        The overall TimeValidity period defined by the “start” and “end”
        properties in the “TimeValidity” object shall strictly bound (i.e.,
        override) any periods defined in the Period object.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that where an invalid (exception) period overlaps (intersects) a
        valid period the validity shall be regarded as invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a name="_Ref135770267">Figure</a>31 – UML model representation of the
        Period Object
    </p>
    <p>
        Each instance of Period may have a given periodName, and also may have
        specified date times indicating the startOfPeriod and endOfPeriod. If
        the startOfPeriod or the endOfPeriod are unspecified the date times of
        the related TimeValidity object instance may bound applicability.
    </p>
    <p>
        An instance of a Period object is typically used to define patterns of
        applicability of a regulation (or exceptions). This is done in
        conjunction with several ‘child’ objects. These are described below.
        These ‘child’ objects can be combined in several ways to express
        different patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
        An illustrative example is a permanent TRO for a parking restriction.
        This fictitious TRO was made in early 2022 and came in effect on 1 <sup>
        st</sup> June 2022. It is applicable between 15 <sup>th</sup> June and
        30 <sup>th</sup> September each year, and between the hours of 07:00 and
        09:30am and again between 16:00 and 18:30 on weekdays, except public
        holidays.
    </p>
    <p>
        The optional attribute “recurringPeriod”, if populated, indicates that
        the startOfPeriod and endOfPeriod attributes are considered to define
        the first instance of a recurring period. The attribute
        “recurringPeriod” defines the duration between the start of instances of
        recurring periods.” The “recurrents” attribute is optional and can
        define a number of repetitions if required – this is not typically the
        case of permanent regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
        To support use cases where the start and ends of recurring periods are
        defined by a changeable date (such as Good Friday, or Easter), the use
        of the ChangeableTimePeriod object and its children allowed changeable
        dates to be defined, and these will overide the startOfPeriod and
        endOfPeriod attributes.

        The TimePeriodOfDay object has two mandatory attributes, which indicate
        the time of day of the start and end of the period with local times
        being used when defining validity.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the example given above, the first instance of the TimePeriodOfDay
        object contains the attribute ‘startTimeOfPeriod’ with the value 07:00am
        (07:00:00) and the attribute ‘endTimeOfPeriod’ with the value 09:30am
        (09:30:00). The second instance of the TimePeriodOfDay object contains
        the attribute ‘startTimeOfPeriod’ with the value 4:00pm (16:00:00) and
        the attribute ‘endTimeOfPeriod’ with the value 6:30pm (18:30:00).

    <p>
        This addresses the local challenge of daylight saving time changes, but

        the Calendar week starting on a Monday. Several days of the first week
        of the month may occur in the previous calendar month. By construction,
        the last week of a preceding month can also be the first week of a
        subsequent month.

        Figure 40 provides the UML class representation of the

        ChangeableTimePeriodEnd. Both objects work in a similar manner. A “fuzzy
        time” period is defined in several European standards as the time period
        with non-precise characteristics. However, this is actually a poor
        definition for the concept. The actual concept is a time qualification
        that is not fixed and may be variable in nature. The variation may be
        highly predictable (such as dusk or dawn), or defined by external
        factors and authorities (such as school terms times in a specific
        locality). Hence in the D-TRO Data Specification we do not use the term
        ‘Fuzzy Period’, but rather ‘ChangeableTimePeriod’.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use of the ChangeableTimePeriodStart object and/or the

        attribute:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The mandatory ‘startType’ attribute (‘endType’ for the
        ChangeableTimePeriodEnd object), indicates the type of characteristic
        time measure being used. Values include: ‘dawn’, ‘dusk’, ‘holiday’, and
        ‘external’.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ChangeableTimePeriodStart and ChangeableTimePeriodEnd objects define
        the nature of the Changeable Time period. They do not provide the
        specific means to determine what the instances of period starts and ends
        are. This is done by one of three mechanisms:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Use of the ChangeableTimePeriodSource object which points to an
            external data resource.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use of the ChangeableTimePeriodEntry object or objects gives
            specific date time value which is associated with a start or stop.
            Use of several objects can build up a schedule or calender of start
            entries and/or stop entries.
        </li>
        <li>
            By use of the linkage between a ChangeableTimePeriodStart object
            and/or ChangeableTimePeriodEnd object with the SpecialDay object –
            i.e. indicating that the start and/or end is a special day (e.g.
            Easter).

        The ChangeableTimePeriodSource object has two mandatory attributes:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The ‘definition’ attribute is a free-text string that describes
        the nature of the external data source.

        ●       The ‘sourceLocator’ attribute is a URI hyperlink providing the
        accessible location for retrieval of the external data source.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each instance of ChangeableTimePeriodSource will have a definition to
        explain the nature of the source of data that provides the accurate
        timings. E.g. for a changeable time period of school term times, it
        could be a Government website which shares these dates. The
        “sourceLocator” will then provide the specific data elements from the
        hyperlink of the website through the URI.

        About Conditions and Exclusions
    </h2>
    <p>
        Being able to specify conditions that apply to regulations is a key
        element of D-TRO modelling. Such conditions enable regulation properties
        to detail, for example, width restrictions; access restrictions by
        vehicle type; conditions applied under different weather conditions,
        etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        The D-TRO model for Conditions is used to specify conditions or
        constraints that apply to a Regulation. These include time period,
        vehicle type, weather conditions, etc. Figure 44 provides the UML class
        representation of the Condition related objects.

        In any instance where more than one Condition is to be included in the

    </p>
    <p>
        A ConditionSet object may be specified using a sequence of Conditions
        with logical operators specifying the relationship of the conditions. An
        example is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        &lt;ConditionSet operator = ”OR”&gt;
    </p>
    <p>
        &lt;ConditionSet operator = ”AND” &gt;

    <p>
        &lt;VehicleCondition…/ &gt;

    <p>
        &lt;/ConditionSet&gt;
    </p>
    <p>
        &lt;ConditionSet operator = ”AND” &gt;
    </p>
    <p>
        &lt;TimeCondition…/ &gt;
    </p>
    <p>
        &lt;VehicleCondition…/ &gt;

    </p>
    <p>
        &lt;/ConditionSet&gt;
    </p>
    <p>
        Or, the same example in an alternate notation:
    </p>
    <p>
        ((TimeCondition and VehicleCondition) or (TimeCondition and
        VehicleCondition))
    </p>
    <p>
        A condition stating VehicleType = EmergencyVehicle and negate = true
        would mean all vehicles except those of type EmergencyVehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
        An unset negate value means the same as false, i.e., no negation
        applied.

    <p>
        We will use the MaximumGrossWeightCharacteristic object to illustrate
        this pattern. This enables limits for maximum gross weight to be
        defined. If gross weight limits are defined in theory there could be two
        limits – an upper bound (maximum weight) and a lower bound (minimum
        weight), as show in Figure 59.
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, upper bounds are specified in TROs, so the maximum
        characteristic is used.

        ●       The mandatory ‘grossVehicleWeight’ attribute provides the
        numeric value for the boundary condition. It is specified in metric
        tonnes, with one decimal place.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The mandatory ‘typeOfWeight’ attribute identifies different
        forms of weight limit that may be specified. Permissible weight types
        include ‘actual’, ‘combinedMaximumPermitted’, ‘maximumPermitted’,
        ‘unladen’.

        The Data Model (and associated schema) defines categorised lists of
        short name terms that represent different concepts and choices. Examples
        of these lists include regulation type, vehicle type, permit type, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is intended that the Data Model covers a broad spectrum of choices
        covering a vast majority of TROs to be produced in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        Future Statutory Guidance and best practice documentation will strongly
        encourage reuse of standardised concepts. However, it is prudent that
        the Data Model also supports the ability to define new or unusual
        concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, the ability to support additional enumerations would be
        prudent for several of the enumerated lists existing in the Data Model.
        These include:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       permitType
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       payloadType
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       vehicleUsageType
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       emissionsClassificationEuroType
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       fuelType
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       vehicleEquipmentType
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       vehicleType
    </p>
    <p>
        To maintain the simplicity in the Data Model, it is easiest to add
        <a name="_Int_3UhUzG1M">an "other"</a> enumeration value to each of the
        enumerated lists stated. For regulationType, there is the off-list
        regulation mechanism referred to earlier in the guide that will handle
        additional enumerations.
    </p>
    <p>
        In instances where the "other" enumeration is used further information
        shall be required. In each case the user (the Local Authority) would be
        required to provide a unique enumeration short name (distinct from short
        names that appear in the Data Model) plus a robust definition.
    </p>
    <p>
        The use of "other" on its own shall not be permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rather that adding this extension mechanism to each relevant enumerated
        list in the Data Model, a generic extension mechanism has been added to
        the model.

    <p>
        Temporary TROs (TTROs) can be made for period of up to 18 months. They
        are often made to enable full closures of roads or lane, or temporary
        speed limits, often in support of highway works or street (utility)
        works. TTROs are very common and numerous. Although the duration of a
        TTRO can be reduced to match the expected duration of the associated
        works. It may be pragmatic to set the period of the TTRO to be longer to
        permit operational flexibility in when works are carried out, and to
        also support overrunning works.
    </p>
    <p>
        A TTRO, like other TROs, could contain multiple Provisions. Therefore,
        the capabilities to record 'real-time' starts and stops of occupancy
        could be recorded for a TTRO as a whole or for one of its Provisions.
        The wording concerning the timing and technical approach to recording
        and sharing data with the D-TRO Service is yet to be defined. The
        existing Data Model does not (yet) support this capability.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Data Model includes the need to provide a lightweight mechanism to
        receive start and stop notifications. It is assumed the parent TTRO will
        be recorded and "active" (i.e. between its notional start datetime and
        end datetime) in the Central Service. With assigned IDs for the TTRO as
        a whole and also for any Provision it contains.
    </p>
    <p>
        The current requirement is captured through the Data Model as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Start and Stop notices will be related to either the whole TTRO
        or a specified Provision of a TTRO.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Records management should not (initially) be overly demanding
        and rigid, i.e. if a Stop notice is received it should not be rejected
        because no Start notice has been previously received. (to confirm)
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       If a start or stop notice is received for a whole TTRO, it can
        be considered to overwrite the status of child Provisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       The real-time status of the whole TTRO or one to many of
        Provisions should be able to be set and varied.

            4.                    What is a ‘full’ D-TRO Record?

    </h1>
    <p>
        When a TRA submits a new D-TRO record care is required to ensure that
        the record contains all necessary information – this is the
        responsibility of the TRA. The D-TRO Service will undertake various
        forms of validation to ensure that requirements have been met and the
        D-TRO record can be accepted.

        </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Two primary forms of validation test are foreseen:
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Schema validation – this is a set of technical tests to ensure
        that that the data and the structure of the submitted D-TRO record
        conforms to the requirements of the Data Model and schema. These tests
        will check that mandatory elements of the Data Model exist in the D-TRO
        record; that the supplied data conforms to prescribed data types (e.g.
        if an attribute that the data contained with an attribute which is
        defined as a DateTime in the Data Model, is supplied data is a date time
        in an acceptable format), etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        ●       Semantic validation – this is a further set of technical tests
        that the schema validated data meets further requirements. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
        •    The mandatory ‘ta’ attribute of the Source object contains not only
        an Integer value, as required by schema validation, but the value given
        matches a value in the

    <p>
        A set of validation tests have been created, which are summarised in the
        tables below. A detailed document of the validation rules is available
        on the GitHub. <strong></strong>
