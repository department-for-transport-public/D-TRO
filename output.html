        class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Department for Transport (DfT) is modernising the
        regulatory framework for Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs)
        (Traffic Management Orders in London) made under the Road
        Traffic Regulation Act 1984.</p>
        <p>The new regulatory framework will, subject to necessary
        legislation coming into force, mandate that traffic authorities
        in England publish TROs as open data in a standardised and
        digital format that anyone can access, use and share. The
        standardised digital format will be based on the Digital TRO
        (D-TRO) Data Model that is described in this document – called
        the Data Model throughout the remainder of this document. The
        Data Model is intended to be a free resource for all. The Data
        Model is candidate in nature and may be subject to change
        without notification.</p>
        <p>Taking into account the needs arising from the UK Industrial
        Strategy and recognising the requirements that will emerge from
        the deployment of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) the
        Data Model provides an initial framework for how the data and
        information relating to TROs can be formed in the future.
        Availability of this Data Model, will support the move towards
        TROs being easily accessible to the public whether using apps or
        driving connected vehicles.</p>
        <p>The Automated Vehicles Act 2024<a href="#fn1"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> (section 93) provides the

        form, to be provided in accordance with a specified model,
        standard or set of specifications. These will be the D-TRO Data
        Specifications including the D-TRO Data Model and are expected
        to be specified under secondary legislation.</p>

        <p>The content of the Data Model has been developed by Harrod
        Booth Consulting Ltd with grateful support from numerous
        organisations.</p>
        <p>The report presents the Data Model, Release 3.4.0, with a
        series of larger updates including:</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Use of camelCase structure to all objects and properties
        within the Data Model.</p></li>
        <li><p>Additional objects and attributes added in response to
        the expected functional needs resulting from Secondary
        Legislation</p></li>
        <li><p>Additional properties and attributes added or updated in
        response to the stakeholder comments.</p></li>
        <li><p>A few attribute datatypes have been changed.</p></li>
        <li><p>Extension Enumeration capabilities have been added
        for:</p>

        <p>Additionally, further changes have been made beyond the scope
        of the Data Model:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Use of x-app-id and x-correlation-id have been removed.
        Now, once the actor (DSP/TRA or Consumer) is passing the bearer

        <p>This document outlines the data modelling concepts defined to
        help support the definition and exchange of information relating
        traffic regulations, particularly within the scope of TROs as
        specified under UK legislation (notably the Automated Vehicles
        Act 2024, section 93).</p>
        <p>As explained in the introductory sections of this document
        the Data Model contained and described here is by its nature
        developmental and evolutionary. Users, developers and
        stakeholders are encouraged to review and use this Model and
        provide feedback and any identified issues to the DfT.</p>

        <p>The existing informational content of the existing legacy
        TROs in the UK is diverse, rich, and in some cases somewhat
        incompatible with a more limited, regularised approach defined
        in this specification for digitising traffic regulations.</p>
        <p>This Data Model has been the subject of ongoing development,
        validation and piloting. It is not expected to be error-free or
        covering the full spectrum of TROs – but it is expected to
        support the digital encoding of a significant majority of
        TROs.</p>
        <p>This document is primarily intended to be read by
        technologists who are familiar with data modelling concepts,
        especially use of UML, as the contained diagrams are expressed

        <p>As this specification evolves it is expected that additional

        <p>TROs are UK legislative instruments used by highways
        authorities to implement changes on the road network. They are
        used for such diverse purposes as:</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li><blockquote>
        <p>managing the use of the road with measures such as parking

        <p>Innovations in transport and increasingly data-supported
        mobility are emerging. Foundational data, such as access to
        digital Traffic Regulation Measures, supports improved use of

        Authorities. Its key findings relating to TROs were that:</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li><blockquote>
        <p>TRO data is difficult and time consuming to access, clean and
        process,</p>
        </blockquote></li>
        <li><blockquote>
        <p>TRO data is not in a standardised, machine-readable
        format,</p>

        <li><blockquote>
        <p>TROs lack of a centralised point of reference,</p>

        identify improvements to the legislative process in England.
        Strongly recommended development of the TRO data model as a
        matter of priority.</p>
        <p>Through 2019-20 DfT worked with several local authorities to
        undertake a <strong>first validation of the TRO Data
        Model</strong> with 8 Local Authorities and market-leading
        solution providers.</p>
        <p>DfT commissioned the <strong>TRO Data Model Alpha</strong>
        [undertaken by Valtech] (2020-21) giving recommendations on
        expected market deployment of the TRO data model, and how TRO
        data from LAs would be made available.</p>
        <p>In 2021-22 there was further data model validation and
        enhancement using real-world <strong>Data Model

        <p>Data modelling is by its nature open to interpretation,
        different approaches and may reflect the personal preferences of
        those developing it.</p>
        <p>DfT agreed that the modelling approach would seek to achieve
        several aims:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>It provides as simple a structure as is possible to model
        a wide spectrum of traffic regulation concepts as is
        practicable</p></li>
        <li><p>Where appropriate, aligned to internationally recognised
        standards (see section 3.6).</p></li>
        <li><p>Based on an appropriate and relevant data
        structure.</p></li>
        <li><p>Compatible with other standards where possible.</p></li>
        <li><p>As open and accessible as possible.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The management and exchange of traffic regulations and TROs
        is a strengthening need, that will support the digitisation of
        traffic, vehicle automation and enhanced data-centric transport
        and mobility services.</p>
        <p>Transport and mobility include both the short local and
        cross-border long-distance journey. There is a need to develop
        common national mechanisms to ensure the efficient and safe
        movement of vehicles and road users. Commonality is needed to
        support travel between jurisdictions, but also the consistent
        sharing and use of TRO data.</p>
        <p>At present, although international conventions support the
        free movement of road traffic and general conditions for safe
        common road use, and other road features such as common aspects
        of road signs, there are no existing common technical standards
        for how to encode and model road traffic regulations.</p>
        <p>The Data Model is the first national recognised effort to
        support such encoding, expressly for the purpose of exchanging
        details concerning road traffic regulations, their location and

        Data Model is expected to form part of the “with a specified
        model, standard or set of specifications” specifications as
        mentioned in the Automated Vehicles Act 2024, section 93(8).</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>TROs are complex and have been specified by highway
        authorities (and now TRAs) over an extended period, with quite
        some variation of style and approach. Developing the Data Model
        is challenging and therefore choices and simplifications are
        needed. The Data Model has been subject to modification and
        enhancement through a series of projects and also in response to
        comments and issues raised through validation undertaken by some
        Local Authorities and their existing TRO software service
        providers.</p>
        <p>Onward reviews and use of this model will identify omissions
        and exceptions, but the design principles adopted seek to
        provide clear data modelling constructs to cover a range of key
        concepts.</p>
        <p>When considering TROs there are various aspects that could be
        the subject of modelling:</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li><blockquote>
        <p>The legal Order itself, as made by the TRA</p>
        </blockquote></li>
        <li><blockquote>
        <p>Road network features (instantiated by the Order) that
        control the movement of traffic, use of the highways, etc, which
        includes the modelling of the traffic effect of the regulation
        for that feature</p>
        </blockquote></li>
        <li><blockquote>
        <p>Modelling of road traffic signs</p>
        </blockquote></li>
        <li><blockquote>
        <p>Modelling of road markings and other traffic management
        measures</p>
        </blockquote></li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
        <p>DfT focus for the Data Model has been to develop a firm
        technical basis to support the encoding, exchange, storage and
        distribution of details of the legal contents of the TRO
        itself.</p>
        <p>The scope of the Data Model covers all different forms of
        Order (permanent, temporary, experimental and notices) for both
        moving and stationary traffic.</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>The following design principles have reflected the shaping of
        the Data Model:</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li><p>The scope of the Data Model shall cover all different
        forms of Order (permanent, temporary, experimental and notices)
        for both moving and stationary traffic.</p></li>
        <li><p>The Data Model will seek to include the full semantic
        contents of (a largely majority of) TROs. This notes that there
        is wide variety in the form and content of existing TROs, and
        attempting to model all content and options is both impractical
        and counter-productive to the intent of creating standardised
        digital TRO records based on a common data structure as defined
        by the Data Model.</p></li>
        <li><p>The Data Model will seek to simplify data structures as
        much as practical.</p></li>
        <li><p>The Data Model design will be cognisant of user needs in
        terms of provisioning of digital TRO records, the most likely
        use cases for consumption and reuse of digital TRO records, and
        supporting DfT policy objectives, as well as supporting
        automated validation.</p></li>
        <li><p>Where appropriate, the Data Model will align, and reuse
        concepts specified in appropriate European or International
        Standards.</p></li>
        <li><p>The Data Model shall be extensible. The current
        landscape, format and content of ‘made’ TROs contains wide
        diversity. As part of the process of digitalising and
        regularising TRO information in the form of D-TRO records, it is
        essential to try to bound possible options and characteristics
        in an extensive, inclusive but ultimately limited way. It is
        important to provide technical mechanisms within the structure
        of the Data Model and its implementation in the D-TRO service to
        enable some of the key vocabulary to be extended in an ad-hoc
        user driven way.</p>
        <p>It is a matter of service governance that use of the
        extension mechanism, mentioned above, should only be used when
        absolutely necessary. This will ensure that the consistency of
        the collected set of D-TRO records is maintained. However,
        legitimate need to extend values beyond the ‘hard coded’ values
        in the Data Model is essential. Regular use of extended items
        should raise the need for their consideration of inclusion in a
        revision of the Data Model – as part of the expected regime of
        the Data Model governance.</p></li>
        <li><p>The Data Model shall be designed and represented in a
        manner that aligns with Government policies and is portable, and
        suitable for long term maintenance.</p></li>

        class="header-section-number">2.4</span> User- and Policy-driven
        needs</h2>
        <p>As reflected in the design principles, above, ongoing work is
        reviewing user needs for digital TRO records, and therefore the
        foreseen deployment of the D-TRO Service and the Data Model.</p>
        <p>This section does not seek to replicate the wide spectrum of
        needs but highlights a handful of considerations that shape the
        way in which the Data Model is expected to be used.</p>
        <p>DfT, through the previous Service Alpha and current Beta
        Project, are reviewing and enhancing user needs analysis,
        prototyping the D-TRO Service, and reviewing the Data Model.
        Therefore, updates and changes may occur.</p>
        <p>The DfT’s preferred option is to establish a centralised
        service which receives digital TROs (D-TROs) from TRAs, stores
        these records, and exposes data services for consumers to
        request distribution of D-TRO records. The Data Model forms the
        technical baseline for D-TRO records.</p>
        <p>Due to the variety of different forms of TRO and notices
        permitted under the legislation, there is a need to define in
        future legislation and statutory guidance when in the lifecycle
        of orders and notices the TRA will be required to provide a
        D-TRO record to the D-TRO Service. The current expectation is
        that the following Reporting Points are needed – see Figure
        2.</p>
        <p>Figure 2 – D-TRO Reporting Points</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><img src="media/media/image2.png"

        alt="A screenshot of a project Description automatically generated" /></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>These Reporting Points are reflected in the Data Model in an
        enumerated list named ‘orderReportingPointType’<a href="#fn5"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
        <p>It is not foreseen that the D-TRO Central Service will in the
        future retain a full, growing library of all D-TROs submitted
        over time, but retain recently submitted D-TRO records and those
        that remain current. The Service is also expected to hold future
        D-TRO records, and those that have recently expired, or replaced
        by a newer amended version, or revoked. The precise definition
        of this Service is currently being defined through this Beta
        project, with initial version for a records management
        capability being implemented.</p>
        <p>Version 3.4 introduces additional objects and attributes
        added in response to expected functional needs resulting from
        the Secondary Legislation.</p>
        <p>Note: many of these changes apply to Made orders (whether on
        initial making, amendment or revocation). The following
        orderReportPoint types, as reflected in Figure 2, are included
        in the list of Made orders:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>"experimentalAmendment",</p></li>

        <p>One of the technical aspects within the D-TRO Beta Data
        Specification which requires further clarification and
        resolution, is how to systematically encode information relating
        to the spatial location and positioning used within TROs.
        Currently, an approach has been proposed to shape the data
        structures that are needed to support it within the D-TRO Beta
        Data Specification and its Data Model.</p>
        <p>In order to make future digital TROs useable to the widest
        set of stakeholders and applications the provision of a coded
        location that is machine-interpretable and can be related to
        specific spatially coded locations on digital maps is considered
        essential.</p>
        <p>Following stakeholder comment, DfT has revised the proposed
        recommended approach. Given the need to reduce barriers to
        uptake during the D-TRO Beta project phase, no singular
        preferred approach is mandated. Therefore, for example, a speed
        limit TRO provision can be represented either by linear road
        centreline/reference line features (polyline) or by use of a
        polygon. Similarly, kerb line regulations can be represented as
        a polyline, a polygon or both. This approach will be reviewed
        during the D-TRO Beta project, taking on board feedback
        primarily from data consumers concerning the useability of mixed
        approach data.</p>
        <p>DfT prefers the use of polygons, but these are not
        mandatory.</p>
        <p>Some forms of TRO do require special treatment to ensure that
        the data can be correctly interpreted. This special treatment
        applies to:</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Gate/point locations</p></li>
        <li><p>Directional regulations (such as no entry, one-way
        streets, turning movements, etc.)</p></li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
        <p>There is a need to provide clear guidance and a common
        approach to enable TRAs to code TRO locations.</p>
        <p>Single consolidated or other TROs may represent a range of
        measures (Provisions) impacting different locations – this
        approach should support TRAs identifying and encoding “regulated
        place” in a manner that they consider appropriate. The approach
        aims to limit specific coding rules to a practical minimum,
        enabling both alignment with the more commonly used existing
        practice whilst counter-balancing use of a limited number of
        coding mechanisms which will aid greater commonality and
        interoperability of data.</p>
        <p>In general, if a TRO regulation is identified as being
        effective at two or more distinct locations, each location
        should be treated as a separate "regulated place", as laid out
        in the D-TRO Data Specification. The design approach aims to
        address the wide spectrum of different forms of shape that TRO
        regulations can take.</p>
        <p>The standardised approach:</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li><p>should not be tied to a specific form of reference base
        map data set.</p></li>
        <li><p>shall use a widely understood and supported standardised
        data format.</p></li>
        <li><p>should be cognisant of the level of effort required to
        achieve it.</p></li>
        <li><p>should support the needs of identified use cases, so far
        as these are defined.</p></li>
        <li><p>should separate the principles of what is being encoded,
        from the actual IT-centric coding mechanism itself.</p></li>

        class="header-section-number">2.8</span> Standardised Terms and
        Definitions</h2>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The transition to digital TROs necessitates the
        standardisation of terms and definitions to ensure consistency,
        interoperability, and clarity across different TRAs and
        platforms.</p>
        <p>Standardisation becomes increasingly important to ensure
        consistency and interoperability by facilitating a uniform
        understanding of traffic regulations across various regions and
        platforms. This uniformity is essential for the development of
        interoperable digital systems that can communicate and integrate
        seamlessly. For instance, a term like "no-stopping"
        (kerbsideNoStopping) should have a universally accepted
        definition to avoid discrepancies between different technology
        providers used by TRAs, navigation systems, and other traffic
        management applications.</p>
        <p>Clear and consistent definitions in digital TROs help in
        maintaining legal clarity. Inconsistent or ambiguous terms can
        lead to misinterpretation of the regulations, resulting in legal
        challenges and non-compliance. With D-TROs also supporting the
        rise of intelligent transport systems, automated vehicles, and
        advanced navigation aids, this depends heavily on the
        availability of standardised digital information. For these
        technologies to function correctly and interact with human
        drivers and existing infrastructure, they need access to precise
        and consistent regulatory data.</p>
        <p>Recognising the critical need for standardisation, an
        assessment is currently underway to collate and analyse the
        varied uses of terms across different sources relevant to TROs.
        This comprehensive assessment involves examining the language
        used in existing TRO documents from multiple authorities,
        reviewing legislative texts, and consulting with stakeholders in
        the Transport Technology Forum and wider. The goal is to
        identify inconsistencies and ambiguities in the current
        terminologies and to propose a harmonised set of definitions
        that can be adopted universally.</p>

        <p>This section provides a tour of the main features of the Data
        Model.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Figure 3 shows a summarised simplified view of the main
        structures of the Data Model. These structures often contain
        more detailed sub-models, which are detailed later in this
        section.</p>
        <p>One way to think of the organisation of the information is
        that each Digital TRO record (D-TRO record) contains the
        information contained in one TRO. Each D-TRO record needs to
        contain information on the ‘what’, ‘where’, ‘when’, and ‘who’
        concepts. The ‘who’ concept is covered by what conditions apply,
        and what exemptions or exclusions exist. For TROs that incur a
        form of payment or charging, the 'how much' concept can also be
        expressed.</p>
        <p>As denoted in Figure 3, these concepts are held within
        different structures.</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>Each TRO will be characterised by one D-TRO record. In other
        words, all the informational detail of one TRO should be
        contained in one D-TRO record.</p>
        <p>Note: There is a set of metadata attributes that contain
        information on when the D-TRO record was published by the TRA or
        their software service provider, and the identity of the
        publishing entity. These metadata elements form part of the
        exchange mechanism itself and sit beyond the contents of the
        Data Model, forming part of the schema used for exchange.
        Details of these metadata attributes are provided in the Data
        Specification’s Interface Control Documents.</p>
        <p>The <strong>source</strong> object contains basic information
        concerning which TRA which created this TRO, the TRA which is
        the current owner of the TRO, the TRAs that are affected by the
        TRO. The formal published name of the TRO is also supported.</p>
        <p>Additionally, <strong>source</strong> permits linking to any
        other digitised TRO that is referenced within this TRO. The
        cross reference is the unique D-TRO record identifier ID, not a
        textual name of a TRO.</p>
        <p>In each D-TRO record, it is possible to define one or many
        source objects, with each source object being related to one
        section or clause in the TRO.</p>

        object.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>The ‘section’ attribute</strong> indicates the
        clause, schedule, or article defined by the TRA where the

        ID provided to link to the current source on which the action is
        being executed. The data type is ActionType (enumeration).
        Possible values are shown in Figure 6. This attribute is
        mandatory and must be provided exactly once.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The ‘reference’ attribute</strong> is a unique
        identifier for each instance of a Source by originating TRA. The
        precise format of the reference is not prescribed and is left to
        the discretion of the data supplier. It is, however, mandatory
        and shall be unique for the originating TRA. The data type is a
        (free text) String. This attribute is required and must be
        provided exactly once.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The ‘comingIntoForceDate’ attribute</strong>
        specifies the date on which the TRO comes into legal effect. The
        data type is a date. This attribute is conditional and must be
        provided exactly once for <em>Made Orders</em>. For more
        details, please see section 2.4.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The ‘currentTraOwner’ attribute</strong>
        identifies the current Traffic Regulation Authority responsible
        for maintaining this D-TRO. The value should correspond to a
        SWA-like authority code. The data type is an integer. This
        attribute is required and must be provided exactly
        once.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The ‘madeDate’ attribute</strong> indicates the
        date that the TRO was made, if applicable. The data type is a
        date. This attribute is conditional and must be provided exactly
        once for <em>Made Orders</em>. For more details, please see
        section 2.4</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The ‘statementDescription’ attribute</strong>
        provides a description of the overall nature of the prohibition,
        regulation, or restriction imposed by the TRO. The data type is
        a (free text) String. This attribute is conditional and must be
        provided at least once for <em>Made Orders</em> and may appear
        multiple times if needed. For more details, please see section
        2.4</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The ‘traAffected’ attribute</strong> identifies
        the Traffic Regulation Authorities whose roads are affected by
        this D-TRO. The value should correspond to one or more SWA-like
        codes. The data type is an integer. At least one entry is
        required. Note: this must include the creating TRA.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The ‘traCreator’ attribute</strong> identifies
        the Highway Regulation Authority that created the D-TRO. The
        value should be a SWA-like code. The data type is an integer.
        This attribute is mandatory and must be provided exactly
        once.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The ‘troName’ attribute</strong> is the cited
        name of the Traffic Regulation Order (TRO) as defined by the
        Traffic Regulation Authority (TRA). The data type is a (free
        text) String. This attribute is mandatory and must be provided
        exactly once. This should be the full legal name of the
        order.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The SWA-like codes will be defined is a manner similar to the
        SWA codes used for street works. These attributes allow the
        tracing of the original creator and current responsible TRA
        owner and also those TRAs affected – this supports where
        boundary changes, authority name changes, etc. It will be quite
        common for all three attributes to identify the same TRA where
        no significant changes have occurred, and the TRO content
        relates only to the originating TRA’s road network.</p>
        <p>Note the SWA-like codes follow the SWA codes published for
        Street Works, see <a

        Provisions are an important concept – each instance of provision
        represents specifically one type of <strong>regulation</strong>,
        subject to one set of homogeneous conditions (conditions,
        exemptions, and times of applicability, and, if applicable,

        <p>The <strong>provision</strong> object defines several
        mandatory attributes.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>The ‘actionType’ attribute</strong> indicates the
        action to be carried out by the provision, with a ‘reference’ ID
        provided to link to the current provision the action is being
        carried out on. See section 3.2. The data type is ActionType
        (enumeration). This attribute is mandatory and must be provided
        exactly once.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The ‘comingIntoForceDate’ attribute</strong>
        specifies the date on which the provision comes into legal
        effect. The data type is date. This attribute is conditional and
        may be provided exactly once for <em>Made Orders</em>. For more
        details, please see section 2.4</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The ‘expectedOccupancyDuration’
        attribute</strong> specifies the expected duration (in integer
        days) of the provision’s occupancy. The data type is duration.
        This attribute is optional but recommended especially for
        temporary, or special event orders.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The ‘orderReportingPoint’ attribute</strong>
        indicates at which of the recognised reporting points this
        provision instance rests. Reporting points are described in more
        detail in section 2.4. The data type is OrderReportingPointType
        (enumeration). This attribute is mandatory and must be provided
        exactly once.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The ‘provisionDescription’ attribute</strong>
        provides a free text description of the referenced provision.
        The data type is a string (free text). This attribute is
        mandatory and must be provided exactly once.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The ‘reference’ attribute</strong> is a unique
        identifier for each instance of a provision by the originating
        TRA. The precise format of the reference is not prescribed and
        is left to the discretion of the data supplier. It is, however,
        mandatory and shall be unique for the originating TRA. The data
        type is a string (free text). This attribute is required and
        must be provided exactly once.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The provision class may also be extended by either an
        experimentalVariation object or an experimentalCessation
        object.</p>
        <p>The experimentalVariation object can only be applied to
        "experimentalAmendment" orderReportingPoint type, where an
        experimental order is subject to amendment.</p>
        <p>The experimentalCessation object can only be applied to
        "experimentalRevocation" orderReportingPoint type, where an
        experimental order is revoked.</p>

        <p>The <strong>experimentalVariation</strong> defines two
        mandatory attributes.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>The effectOfChange attribute</strong> provides a
        free-text description of the regulatory effect introduced or
        modified by the experimental variation. This may include details
        such as changes to restrictions, permissions, or the
        introduction of new conditions.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The expectedDuration attribute</strong> indicates
        the expected duration of the experimental variation, expressed
        as integer days. This defines the planned period over which the
        variation will be active before reassessment or
        reversion.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This object supports the structured representation of
        temporary modifications within a D-TRO and allows for clear
        communication of their intended scope and timeline.</p>

        <p>The <strong>experimentalCessation</strong> object used to
        define the characteristics of a cessation applied to an
        experimental Traffic Regulation Order. This object enables the
        structured recording of the end of an experimental regulatory
        provision, including both the cessation date and its
        rationale.</p>
        <p>It is associated with a provision that was enacted under
        experimental powers and has since been formally ceased, either
        upon conclusion of its intended trial period or for other
        operational or legal reasons.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>The actualDateOfCessation attribute</strong>
        specifies the actual calendar date on which the Experimental
        Order was ceased. This marks the formal end of the legal effect
        of the provision under experimental authority.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The natureOfCessation attribute</strong> provides
        a free-text explanation of the reason of cessation of
        Experimental Order. This may include administrative withdrawal,
        outcome-based termination, policy changes or legal review
        outcomes.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The experimentalCessation object allows for clear
        documentation of the conclusion of temporary or trial-based
        traffic regulations, supporting auditability and historical
        tracking within the D-TRO framework.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>The ‘isDynamic’ attribute</strong> indicates
        whether the regulation identified is dynamic in nature (i.e.,
        the regulation is triggered by some condition – for example,
        changeable speed limits, access regulations, or triggered by
        environment conditions). The value ‘True’ indicates the
        regulation is dynamic in nature; ‘False’ indicates the
        regulation is static.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The ‘timeZone’ attribute</strong> enables the
        time zone applicable to the regulation to be defined. This is
        important in supporting the management of the definition of
        clearly specified times that work appropriately in local time
        zones. The time zone is specified IANA time zone (see <a
        href="http://www.iana.org/time-zones">http://www.iana.org/time-zones</a>).
        For regulations in the UK will be “Europe/London”.</p></li>

        previous orders will be removed from the “live TRO” list. An

        revocation of a Provision within a previous TRO.</p></li>

        <p>Parking tariffs are varied by use of a <strong>variation by

        <p>A <strong>consolidation</strong> is an administrative process
        and nothing ‘of substance’ should be added or removed.
        Generally, a consolidation would combine a base order and its
        subsequent amendments into a new base order. If something is
        missed from the revocation list of a consolidation, then the
        remaining pre-existing Provisions (partial or whole) might be
        orphaned but still be in force. These always have multiple
        revocations by definition.</p>

        <li><blockquote>
        <p>A <strong>consolidation</strong> can be used to change some
        details of a previously made TRO, so long as this does not
        affect the substance of the Order. Things can be tidied up if
        required (noting there is small defined list of minor changes
        that are allowed) but nothing should be changed that would
        ordinarily require consultation. The opportunity to make changes
        is very limited. However, as a side note, this can be
        complicated by the fact that some people refer to the
        combination of old orders with substantial changes as a
        consolidation, which it is not.</p>

        when and how much, if relevant, of any Provision). This
        requirement is defined by the minimum mandatory data elements
        within the Data Model. Effectively new versions will replace
        older versions within the Live TRO list – old versions will
        remain visible for a while.</p>
        <p>Whilst the central service currently will hold records for
        all D-TRO records it has received, D-TRO records management mean
        that new versions of TROs (and their provisions) – through
        amendments and revocations – will supersede earlier versions.
        Each version is considered to be a complete representation of
        the TRO and its provisions. Older records that have been amended
        or revoked will be visible in the Central Service for a defined
        retention period, before being archived. </p>

        <p>It contains multiple sources and provisions. For the purpose
        of this illustration, we focus on source #1 (with reference
        TRAxxxx-So-01, and actionType = 'new'). It has two child
        provisions:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>At a later point in time, the TRA makes a new (Consolidation)
        TRO with reference TRAxxxx-SO-09, and actionType = 'amendment’.
        We highlight two of the provisions in the example:</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li><blockquote>
        <p>provision #1, with reference: TRAxxxx-Pro-01 and actionType =

        </blockquote></li>
        <li><blockquote>
        <p>provision #7, with reference: TRAxxxx-Pro-12 and actionType =
        ‘fullRevoke’</p>
        </blockquote></li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
        <p>For the new provision #1, as this has the same reference as
        provision #1 from the earlier TRO, and an action type of
        ‘partialAmendment’, this instance of the provision is considered
        to fully replace the earlier instance. The old version of
        provision #1 with reference: TRAxxxx-Pro-01 will be marked in
        the D-TRO Service database as not current and replaced by a
        newer version.</p>
        <p>For provision #7, as this has the same reference as provision
        #2 from the earlier TRO, and an action type of ‘fullRevoke’,
        this instance of the provision is considered to fully replace
        the earlier instance. The old version of provision #2 with
        reference: TRAxxxx-Pro-12 will be marked in the D-TRO Service
        database as not current.</p>
        <p>When using actionTypes for amendment (‘fullAmendment’ or
        ‘partialAmendment’) the old provision (or source is considered
        to be fully replaced by the new provision. The same applies to
        amendment of sources. The distinction between ‘fullAmendment’
        and ‘partialAmendment’ does not change the action of the D-TRO
        service records management, but rather may be helpful metadata
        for data consumers to correctly interpret updates between
        records. The same records management approach applies to
        ‘partialRevoke’.</p>
        <p>Use of ‘fullyRevoke’ does not replace the older record by a
        newer one, but rather triggers the older record to be marked in
        the D-TRO Service database as not current.</p>
        <p>The use of the actionType ‘new’ is interpreted by the D-TRO
        service as the newer records being unrelated to older records.
        Both will be considered to be current in the D-TRO Service
        database.</p>

        <p>In order to make future digital TROs useable to the widest

        location that is machine-interpretable and can be related to
        specific spatially coded locations on digital maps is considered
        essential. Providing clear information on the geographic spatial
        location that are subject to regulations is a critical element
        of the D-TRO record.</p>
        <p>No single preferred approach is mandated at this current
        stage. Therefore, for example, a speed limit TRO provision can
        be represented either by linear road centreline/reference line
        features (polyline) or by use of a polygon. Similarly, kerb line
        regulations can be represented as a polyline, a polygon or
        both.</p>
        <p>The following sections lay out a standardised approach for
        how the location data for TRO regulations should be handled. All
        TRO regulation measures shall be defined geospatially, using
        coordinates and coded in WKT (Well Known Text) format.</p>
        <p>The standardised approach covers general concepts, such as
        where to place spatial polygons or polyline in different

        <li><blockquote>
        <p>Instances where TRO regulations are subject to a direction,

        </blockquote></li>

        <p>The linearGeometry object has four attributes:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>The mandatory ‘representation’ attribute</strong>
        which identifies where the given linear geometry is represents a
        linear feature location (e.g., a stretch of kerbline) and is a
        representation of zonal object (e.g., the reference centreline
        of a length of road, where the location of applicability is the
        whole width of the road for the defined length).</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The mandatory ‘direction’ attribute</strong>
        indicates the direction of the applicability of the referenced
        regulation. Acceptable values are: ‘bidirectional’,
        ‘startToEnd’, and ‘endToStart’. Note this can be used to support
        the definition of the direction of a direction sensitive
        regulation on, say, a single road section (e.g. a northbound
        direction {from the start to the end of the sequence of vertices
        that exists within the polyline} on a one-way street).</p>
        <p>This is distinct from trying to define turning motions
        between two identifiable road sections. For a linearLocation,
        the mandatory link to the National Street Gazetteer shall be
        used to supply all relevant URSN, if they exist. For a
        directedLinear requires reference to a start and an end USRN
        (i.e. two).</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The mandatory ‘lateralPosition’
        attribute</strong> indicates the lateral position across a road
        of the linear representation of a regulated place. Acceptable
        values are: ‘centreline’, ‘onKerb’, and ‘near’ and ‘far’. The
        values near and far are not currently defined in any
        detail!</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>The mandatory ‘linestring’ attribute</strong> is
        a free text field holding the WKT coded representation of
        vertices forming a linestring. By default, two coordinate values
        per vertex are used, however and optional third attribute can be
        defined in instances where the vertical separation of roads and
        regulations need to be defined.</p>

        <p>The polygon object has one mandatory attribute:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>The ‘polygon’ attribute</strong> defines a
        coordinate-polygon that represents the extent of the road
        subject to the TRO regulation. The mandatory ‘polygon’ attribute
        is a free text field holding the WKT-coded representation of
        vertices forming a polygon. By default, two coordinate values
        per vertex are used, however and optional third attribute can be
        defined in instances where the vertical separation of roads and
        regulations need to be defined.</p>

        attribute:</p>

        <li><p><strong>The ‘directedLineString’ attribute</strong>
        specialisation is used for specifying regulations for turning
        movements or directional regulations. The mandatory
        ‘directedLineString’ attribute is a free text field holding the
        WKT-coded representation of vertices forming a polyline. In this
        case, the sequence of vertices defined is considered to be
        significant, the first vertex being considered the start of the
        directedLineString; and the last vertex being considered the end
        of the directedLineString. Intermediate additional vertices can
        be added if they are considered to clarify routing through the
        road network, between the start and the end. By default, two
        coordinate values per vertex are used, however and optional
        third attribute can be defined in instances where the vertical
        separation of roads and regulations need to be defined.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><p>All times are expressed in local time (i.e. without
        reference to UTC time-zone offset). The combination of the
        regulation.timezone attribute and local times enables data
        consumers to calculate the times of applicability in absolute
        times. The rationale for specifying times of applicability in
        local times aligns with common practice for TROs and reduces the
        complexity of the data to be delivered.</p></li>
        <li><p>Dates and times – generally all date and time records
        shall be expressed using the ISO 8601-1:2019 extended format
        (e.g., YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MI:SS) – note: no Z time zone offset. Some
        specific exceptions to this rule do exist – eventTime and
        publicationTime, which are both metadata attributes (beyond the
        scope of this document) are specified using the ISO 8601-1:2019
        extended format for UTC datetimes, indicated by the suffix “Z”
        (e.g., YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MI:SSZ).</p></li>

        <p>The timeValidity object defines overall dates and times
        relating to the applicability of a regulation. It shall be used
        to specify the bounding start and end times of the validity
        period, within which there may be any number of valid and
        invalid (exception) periods. The ‘start’ date time attribute is
        mandatory – in the case where the D-TRO record characterises a
        historic, live regulation and the actual date and time of
        applicability is unknown the start attribute should be set to
        the current time.</p>
        <p>For permanent TROs the end attribute may be omitted.</p>
        <p>The timeValidity model allows intermittent or variable
        patterns of time applicability for TRO regulations to be
        specified.</p>
        <p>Figure 36 shows the UML class representation of the
        <strong>period</strong> object but also note the two links at
        the top of the figure, which allow instances of the period
        object to be specified either as a valid period (i.e., an
        included period) or an exception period (i.e., an excluded
        period where the regulation is not applicable).</p>
        <p>Note: it is a matter of data quality and integrity on behalf
        of the data supplier to ensure the dates and times and periods
        of applicability are complete, consistent and coherent – there
        is nothing in the Data Model per se that stops contradictory or
        conflicting information being specified. Data suppliers should
        take appropriate steps to ensure the quality of the data

        “end” properties in the <strong>timeValidity</strong> object

        <strong>period</strong> object.</p>
        <p>Note that where an invalid (exception) period overlaps
        (intersects) a valid period the validity shall be regarded as
        invalid.</p>

        <p>Each instance of <strong>period</strong> may have a given
        periodName and also may have specified date times indicating the
        startOfPeriod and endOfPeriod. If the startOfPeriod or the
        endOfPeriod are unspecified the date times of the related
        timeValidity object instance may bound applicability.</p>
        <p>An instance of a period object is typically used to define
        patterns of applicability of a regulation (or exceptions). This
        is done in conjunction with several ‘child’ objects. These are
        described below. These ‘child’ objects can be combined in
        several ways to express different patterns.</p>
        <p>An illustrative example is a permanent TRO for a parking
        restriction. This fictitious TRO was made in early 2022 and came
        in effect on 1<sup>st</sup> June 2022. It is applicable between
        15<sup>th</sup> June and 30<sup>th</sup> September each year,
        and between the hours of 07:00 and 09:30am and again between
        16:00 and 18:30 on weekdays, except public holidays.</p>
        <p>The optional attribute “recurringPeriod”, if populated,
        indicates that the startOfPeriod and endOfPeriod attributes are
        considered to define the first instance of a recurring period.
        The attribute “recurringPeriod” defines the duration between the
        start of instances of recurring periods.” The “recurrents”
        attribute is optional and can define a number of repetitions if
        required – this is not typically the case of permanent
        regulations.</p>
        <p>To support use cases where the start and ends of recurring
        periods are defined by a changeable date (such as Good Friday,
        or Easter), the use of the changeableTimePeriod object and its
        children allowed changeable dates to be defined, and these will
        overide the startOfPeriod and endOfPeriod attributes.</p>

        attributes, which indicate the time of day of the start and end
        of the period with local times being used when defining

        attribute ‘endTimeOfPeriod’ with the value 09:30am (09:30:00).
        The second instance of the timePeriodOfDay object contains the
        attribute ‘startTimeOfPeriod’ with the value 4:00pm (16:00:00)
        and the attribute ‘endTimeOfPeriod’ with the value 6:30pm
        (18:30:00).</p>
        <p>This addresses the local challenge of daylight saving time
        changes, but should be taken into account when factoring into
        time-zone based systems.</p>

        <p>The Data Model (and associated schema) defines categorised
        lists of short name terms that represent different concepts and
        choices. Examples of these lists include regulation type,

        <p>It is intended that the Data Model covers a broad spectrum of

        <p>Proposed Statutory Guidance and best practice documentation
        will strongly encourage reuse of standardised concepts. However,
        it is prudent that the Data Model also supports the ability to
        define new or unusual concepts.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the ability to support additional enumerations
        would be prudent for several of the enumerated lists existing in
        the Data Model. These include:</p>

        <p>To maintain the simplicity in the Data Model, it is easiest
        to add an "other" enumeration value to each of the enumerated
        lists stated. For regulationType, there is the off-list
        regulation mechanism referred to earlier in the guide that will
        handle additional enumerations.</p>
        <p>In instances where the "other" enumeration is used further
        information shall be required. In each case the user (the Local

        <p>The use of "other" on its own shall not be permitted.</p>
        <p>Rather that adding this extension mechanism to each relevant
