Rule Type,Description
Data accuracy,An attribute must be representative of its real-world state as per the TRO.
Valid value constraints,"A list of values, a range of values, a constraint on values, a set of allowable characters as part of the D-TRO."
Format constraints,"For dateTime, Values, Geographical Coordinates and other specific formats for fields."
Precision constraints,"The values in the field must be the same precision as the attribute requires in response to D-TRO requirements, business rules and intended meaning, e.g. vehicle dimensions."
Definition constraints,"The values match the intended meaning of the attribute, e.g. coordinate type reflects the value of coordinates entered."
Attribute constraints,"One attribute can be derived from one, two, three or more others, e.g. parking duration restrictions."
Timestamp pattern rule,Ensuring dates and times are within correct ranges.
Reference rule,Ensure a reference system is implemented at each TRA level for tracking previous changes done to its D-TROs
Action rule,Each D-TRO must have one action at the source and provision level provided by the TRA that issues the D-TRO.
