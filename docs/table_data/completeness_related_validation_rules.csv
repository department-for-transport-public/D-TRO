Rule Type,Description
Entity completeness,"The full set of entities are present, i.e. all TRO records with provisions are present"
Relationship completeness,Referential integrity is correct between TROs and provisions i.e. all relationships between entities can be resolved.
Attribute completeness,All required attributes for TRO entities are present i.e. all necessary columns are populated
Domain completeness,"All required attributes contain an allowable value, and intentionally set nulls can be differentiated from absent values"
Identity / uniqueness rules,"Every TRO record must exist only once, be uniquely identifiable, relate to exactly one real-world entity with attributes not being overloaded – e.g. containing different regulation types in a single field"
Entity-relationship constraints,"The existence of one relationship mandates or prohibits the existence of another, e.g. an “Amend” or “Revoke” provision must be linked to an existing D-TRO record."
Attribute-relationship constraints,"The allowable values of one or more values mandates or prohibits the value (or existence) of another, e.g. A vehicle dimension populated for a size-based restriction."
Event-relationship constraints,"Links that must exist for an instance to occur, e.g. activation / inactivation of a TTRO must have an existing TRO present."
Optionality constraints,"Attributes have defined list of options to populate with, e.g. the Speed Limit value."
Inheritance rules,"Existence of all necessary fields from combination of super-type and sub-type. Correct application of implied rules through sub-typing, e.g. activation notices for TTROs."
Granularity rule,Historic data is kept for the same period at similar level of granularity.
Continuity rule,"No gaps or overlaps in historic or time series data for D-TROs, e.g. contradictory time ranges for overlapping TROs."
Event dependencies,"Relating separate events that are likely to be consistent in time, e.g. connection between consultation and the provision of an active TRO."
