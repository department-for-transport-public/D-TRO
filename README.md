The Digital Traffic Regulation Orders (D-TRO) Beta project is currently underway with enhancements proposed to the Data Specification, being conducted by Harrod Booth Consulting Ltd and PA Consulting, working alongside the DfT. Welcome to our Public External GitHub repository.

Private Beta was launched on Tuesday 15 October 2024. Public Beta was launched on 24 September 2025.
 
The latest release version of the Data Specification in the Production Environment is 3.4.1 as part of the D-TRO Beta project for your input and feedback on.

Version 3.4.1 is live in Integration and Production as of 12 August 2025. More details are available at:

https://github.com/department-for-transport-public/D-TRO/issues/1

Documentation and artefacts for v3.4.x are on GitHub. 

All versions v3.3.x (and lower) have been deprecated. 

Version 3.5.0 of the Data Specification is now available in the Integration Environment.

The data model user guide, API documentation and a new Quickstart guide are available at https://d-tro.dft.gov.uk/ - for version 3.5.0. Technical artefacts are made available via our GitHub Repository (https://github.com/department-for-transport-public/D-TRO/tree/main/Candidate%20version%20(v3.5.0)) - this includes examples files, the v3.5.0 schema and data model source file and validation rules documentation.

**Consultation on Secondary Legislation
**

The statutory consultation, which launched on Thursday 23 January 2025, closed on Friday 21 March 2025. More details are available at:

https://ttf.uk.net/2025/01/24/dft-has-issued-a-consultation-on-draft-regulations/

The timing of next steps and the tabling of the Regulations in Parliament will be subject to approval by DfT Ministers. The DfT will also publish guidance to accompany the Regulations.  
 
The DfT acknowledges that Traffic Regulation Authorities and Digital Solution Providers preparing for when it will become a legal requirement to submit new digital traffic regulation orders to the D-TRO Service need clarity on the timetable. The DfT currently envisages that the draft Regulations will be tabled early in the Autumn 2025 session of Parliament. It is this parliamentary process that will set the timetable. 

**GitHub
**

GitHub is the repository for supporting documentation and artefacts required by those participating in validation and providing feedback during the D-TRO Beta phase.
 
See Issue #1 for more details:

Our GitHub folder structure has been updated to make it easier to find documents relating to the latest and other supported versions of the Data Specification.
